The renovation of the property had sparked controversy after it was revealed that taxpayer money had been used, but they have since paid it back. The second agenda item was about Alex Myrtle being found guilty of murdering his wife and son. The third agenda item was about data centers and their evolution from a location of concentrated IT equipment to modular, agile, and highly virtualized compute standards. The meeting ended with Yooni Choi asking for a diagram of lab racks design and reminding everyone to work on their legal questions and watch the Netflix documentary.',\n",

The guilty verdict followed a six-week long trial, more than 20 months after the June 2019 fatal shooting of Mr. Murdaugh's wife Maggie and son Paul. Prosecutors contended that Mr. Murdaugh had killed his son with a shotgun, then gunned down his wife with a rifle, and then quickly sat about creating an alibi by texting and calling his estranged wife and visiting his ailing mother a short drive away. Throughout the trial, Mr. Murdaugh's lawyers argued that the police was sloppy in their investigation and had focused almost exclusively on Mr. Murdaugh, instead of looking for other suspects. However, the jury rejected his claim that he had left the dog kennels where the crimes occurred several minutes before the shootings. The minimum sentence for murder is 30 years in prison, and prosecutors have said they will seek a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\",\n",

They also talked about how the advent of the cloud computing paradigm has contributed to the growth of data centers, which are now classified as infrastructure as a service, software as a service, or platform as a service. The meeting also covered the design requirements of data centers, which depend on their size and use, and the importance of modularity, standardized racks, and power efficiency. The participants also discussed how advances in CPU, integrated circuit, and printed circuit board design have led to faster and more powerful computers within the same area, but also increased power and cooling requirements. They also mentioned that a large data center now consumes several megawatts of power, which is roughly the same power requirements of a small town. Overall, the meeting provided a comprehensive introduction to data centers, their origins, and their growth in size, density, and efficiency.'},\n",

The verdict comes after a nearly six-week-long trial, more than 20 months after the fatal shooting of Mr. Murdaugh's wife Maggie, 52, and his son Paul, 22. The grisly crime had reverberated across the state, in part because of the family's story history of controlling a regional prosecutor's office in South Carolina Low Country region for more than eight years and running an influential law firm for even longer. Prosecutors contended that Mr. Murdaugh had killed his son with a shotgun, then gunned down his wife with a rifle, before quickly setting about creating an alibi. The crucial piece of evidence was a many-long video recorded at the kennels where the murders occurred, which happened to capture Mr. Murdaugh's voice in the background. The video was taken by Mr. Murdaugh in one of his last living moments, inadvertently helping to secure his conviction.

The speakers discussed the evolution of data centers from early computer rooms to modular, highly virtualized facilities that support cloud computing and other web-based services. They explained that data centers come in different sizes and types, including infrastructure as a service, software as a service, and traditional enterprise IT centers. The speakers also discussed the growth of data centers in terms of size, density, and power efficiency, highlighting advances in CPU and storage technology that have allowed for faster and more powerful computers within the same area. They noted that while individual components have become more power efficient, the overall power consumption per rack has risen dramatically in recent years due to increased density.
