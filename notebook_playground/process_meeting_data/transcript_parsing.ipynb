Our agenda for today is to discuss the BM25 algorithm, the Indri probabilistic model, and reranking algorithms for search engines. Let's start with the BM25 algorithm. Dazhi, can you please give us a brief overview of what the BM25 algorithm is and how it works?\",\n",
       "  'Dazhi: Sure, the BM25 algorithm is a ranking function used by search engines to rank documents based on their relevance to a given query. It takes into account the frequency of the query terms in the document and the length of the document. The basic idea behind BM25 is that documents with higher term frequency should be ranked higher, but the impact of term frequency is reduced as the document length increases. This helps to balance the relevance of the document with its length.',\n",

       "  \"Dazhi: Certainly. The Indri probabilistic model is a language modeling approach to information retrieval. It estimates the probability of generating a query from a document and uses this probability to rank the documents. The model is based on the assumption that each document is a mixture of topics, and each query is a mixture of topic models. The model calculates the probability of generating the query from the document's topic distribution and uses this probability to rank the documents.\",\n",
