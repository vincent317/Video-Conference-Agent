3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.550
Yooni Choi: Yeah, tell us about it. You want to visit your girlfriend right?

4
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.570
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah. It was great. I went to North Carolina to visit her.

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.250
Jeffrey Feng: We went out and spent some time exploring good restaurants in Raleigh. It was really nice to see her again.

6
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.210
Vincent: Yeah, and that sounds amazing. I went to Georgia to see my girlfriend to, and I managed to spend some time working on my capsulum project

7
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.740
Vincent: as well as my advanced cloud computing homework.

8
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.530
Yooni Choi: And how did that go?

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:46.210
Vincent: It went pretty well. Actually, I was able to finish both projects, and I think I did a good job. It was nice to be able to focus on it without any distraction.

10
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.280
Jeffrey Feng: That's awesome, man. Congrats on finishing it.

11
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.780
Yooni Choi: And what about you, Jeffrey? Did you get anything done while that while you were there?

12
00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:04.940
Jeffrey Feng: Honestly not really. This homework is too difficult, and I was not able to figure out the design of the spark workflow. But now that i'm back, I need to really focus on getting this project done.

13
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:21.280
Vincent: Yeah, I hear you this project car where for this week I can keep keep working on my capsule. There. I guess you're like Sh them is to go to the advanced Cloud computing office hours and ask the ta for help, and then my action item is to keep working on that capstone

14
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.080
Jeffrey Feng: sounds good to me.

15
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.860
Yooni Choi: Speaking of cloud projects, I actually did some homework, too. While I was in Cancun I was able to finish one of my assignments, but I still have a lot more to do

16
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.780
Jeffrey Feng: That's impressive. I wouldn't even think about doing any work if I were in.

17
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.230
Vincent: That's true. But no, that we are back. We can all focus on getting everything down

18
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:51.970
Yooni Choi: definitely. I will start my next cloud with Simon early, so I have more time to work on my other homework. My action item is to finish my spark assignment for the cloud assignment before Friday.

19
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.190
Jeffrey Feng: That's a good idea, and if you do the same thing

20
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.670
Vincent: same here, we can all hold each other accountable and make sure we stay on track

21
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.410
Yooni Choi: absolutely. It's important to make the most of our time and get everything done on time.

22
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.810
Jeffrey Feng: agreed. So what's next on our agenda? Is that it?

23
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.990
Jeffrey Feng: Oh, wait! We need to talk about what to do after the spring semester ends right.

24
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.380
Vincent: of course. What are your plans?

25
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:25.090
Jeffrey Feng: Well, I have a summer job line up, but it doesn't start until late, so i'll probably stay in Pittsburgh for a while and figure out what to do. In the meantime

26
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.030
Yooni Choi: i'm thinking of going back to Korea for a bit. My job starts in July, so if I have plenty of time between the end of my exams and the start of my job, I might as well make a trip back home.

27
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:44.870
Vincent: That sounds nice. I'm not sure what i'm going to do yet. I my visit my girlfriend again. But I really depends on how things go, because my job might not earlier.
