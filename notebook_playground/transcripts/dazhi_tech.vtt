19
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:45.380
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, this is an interesting question for us to investigate as well whether too much middle management people is actually helping or hurting the company.

20
00:02:45.970 --> 00:03:01.000
Yooni Choi: It makes sense because I can. Meta has kept changing from metaverse to AI or vice versa. There's definitely something wrong with their leadership structure for next week.
