2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.040
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah. I just came back from North Carolina yesterday. I got depressed again, coming back to Pittsburgh.

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.020
Yooni Choi: Me, too. I missed staying in the pools of Cancun.

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:27.850
Vincent: Good. Let's start all we doing. Stand up meetings. We have a mentor meeting coming up next week, and I think it will be great for us to build our work. stay and make progress before meeting with them next week.

5
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:39.900
Jeffrey Feng: Yes, so far, I think Uni has done a great job in only investigating different cloud services as our efficiency. But action, items, and agenda items are still on clear to us.

6
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:50.370
Yooni Choi: I agree there are many Nlp services that we can explore to achieve this task. Have you guys heard about the chat gpt from open AI? I think it would be a great Canada for this task.

7
00:00:50.810 --> 00:01:01.670
Vincent: Yeah, it's amazing. I've been using it extensively from all my at the project. I knew nothing about that. But I keep me at all the great examples about park operation

8
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.840
Vincent: for next week. Wington's action item will be Mass. H. I. D's Apis for extracting agenda and action items from the Meeting Transcript.

9
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.720
Jeffrey Feng: Thank you, Dr. I believe Chat Gbt will definitely help us a lot in this project.

10
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.660
Jeffrey Feng: Okay, moving on to our next session item. Have you guys

11
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.390
Jeffrey Feng: decide what documents we should submit for the next week?

12
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.960
Yooni Choi: Yeah, let me take a quick look at canvas. Okay, we have a plan and design document you next week. Most of this stuff seems to overlap a lot with our previous documents.

13
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.350
Jeffrey Feng: Yes.

14
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:48.450
Jeffrey Feng: for the planned document. We have introduction, different tasks, milestone plans, terminology and acronym explanations, references and reflection

15
00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:00.990
Vincent: for the design document. We have introduction, design countering system, architecture, data design implementation overview design models, test design, deployment and tools and dependency.

16
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:12.060
Yooni Choi: Okay, it doesn't seem too complicated. After finishing the documents who should submit them. I have 3 interviews next week, so I probably won't. Have enough time to double check the documents and submit them.

17
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.670
Jeffrey Feng: I am pretty flexible in the next week, so I am fine with either way submitting the documents on grade scope should be pretty straightforward.

18
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:31.760
Vincent: Yeah, I would also want to focus on itc project next week. I cannot write any code without she. so I will probably spend a lot of time in a office or next week.

19
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.420
Vincent: so I will not also be able to submit them.

20
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.820
Yooni Choi: Okay, Jeff, do you want to submit the documents? You can always let us know if you need any help.

21
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.940
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, sure. I can do that

22
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.560
Jeffrey Feng: for next week. Jeff's action item will be submitting the plan and design document.

23
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.430
Jeffrey Feng: I will let you guys know when I finish. The submission

24
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.350

25
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.340
Yooni Choi: I think we're good. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of what they are supposed to do next.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.310
Jeffrey Feng: Okay, bye, bye.
