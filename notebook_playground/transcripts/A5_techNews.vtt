00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.320
DAZHI PENG: Well, i'm pretty busy this week, so I don't think I could.

11
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.490
Jeffrey Feng: That's fine. I'll take it at the same time the bad news in the tech industry, if that matter started

12

Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, this is an interesting question for us to investigate as well

17
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.970
Jeffrey Feng: whether too much middle management people are actually helping or hurting the company.

18
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.570
Yooni Choi: It makes sense, because Meta has kept changing from Meta to AI, or vice versa, there is definitely something wrong with their leadership structure.
