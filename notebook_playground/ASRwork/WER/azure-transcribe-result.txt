OK, let's start today's meeting since this seems like everyone's here. How was your week? Mine was super busy with three midterms this week, but I'm excited for the spring break. You have any plans? I don't have any plans right now, but I will just say anything here and blah blah blah, you know, it's your turn, Dodger. And uh, I can't wait to leave Pittsburgh. Yeah, sounds fun. Mine was super busy too with all those cloud work, which is still ongoing. I guess I'll I'll be also be working on the pool side while I'm at Cancun. Anyway, let's start off with our first agenda item. Dukan Duchess of Sussex asked to vacate UK home Frogmore Cottage. OK, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has been asked to vacate the Frogmore Cottage, the couples official UK residents, their spokesman told CNN Wednesday. The spokesman said we can confirm that we can purchase of Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage. That is sad. The statement followed reporting British newspaper the song that claimed the pair was being evicted from the property, which is owned by the Crown Estate, and that it had since been offered to Prince Andrew, one of King Charles 3's brother. Buckingham Palace said Wednesday it would be offering no comment. A royal source told CNN that any such discussions would be a private family matter. Prince Harry and Meghan now reside in the United States but have retained the early 19th century property as a UK base, gifted to the Sussex's by the late Queen Elizabeth third the second, the cottage is nestled in 1/4 of the Windsors estate West of London. They refurbished the property and moved in shortly before the arrival of their son Archie in May, not 2019. However, the renovation sparked controversy after the couple stepped back from public life and it emerged about $3 million of British taxpayers money had been used under cottage refurbishments. They have since paid back the public money following their relocation to California. Seems like loyal life, something that I definitely wanted to try out. Yeah, don't even mention someone else. Paying my rent would be amazing works, including the removal of chimney, refinishing the roof, new staircases, fireplace installations and new floating wooden floor with detailing planning application documents to the local console. Because of all fittings, fixtures and furnishings were paid for privately by the Duke and Duchess. I guess we will need to finalize the accounting figure, how much was paid to the Duke and Duchess. Can you work on that by the next meeting? Yes, certainly the success stay at the property when they return to the UK last year, including when they attended the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Celebrations during the summer. Prince Andrew recently resides nearby at the Royal Lodge at on the Windsor Estate. The Duke of York also stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after a disastrous interview about his friendship with disgraced financial Jeffrey Epstein engulfed the family in an unprecedented crisis. According to the to the sun, the couple were reportedly asked to leave the property days after the release of Harry's memoir spare in January. The 38 year old royal held almost nothing back as his dismantle the public's perception of him being the fun loving, carefree party Prince and delved into the devastating impact of his mother's death, his experimentation with drugs as a method of coping with grief, and his struggles at finding love. Buckingham Palace repeatedly declined to comment on the memoir. The autobiography followed the six part Netflix documentary The couple released last year and an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021. They allege there were concerns in the royal family about Archie skin colors, detailed feelings of being trapped and said Maggie has suicidal thoughts to increase her first pregnancy. Something interesting. Can you all watch the show by next week and share your thoughts on it? Yep, we'll do so. Yeah, I was going to watch it anyway soon. I just haven't had a chance to find my free time. OK, let's now move on to our next item, Alex Merdle. Guilty. Alex Murdoch, the first generation lawyer whose family launched their influence in small town courtrooms across parts of South Carolina, was convicted on Thursday of murdering his weapon song, seeing the dramatic downfall of a man who has substantial wealth and powerful connections, but who lived a secret life in which he stole millions of dollars from clients and colleagues and lied to many of those closest to him. Different data types the guilty verdict following a nearly six week long trial more than 24 months after the June 2021 fatal shooting of Mr. Miller's wife Maggie, 52, and your son Paul, 22, on the family royal estate. The grizzly. Crime had reverberated across the state in part because of the story storied history of the middle family, which controlled the regional prosecutor's office in South Carolina Low Country region for more than eight years and ran an influential law firm for even longer. Alan Wilson said today's verdict proved that no one, no one, no matter who you are in society, is above the law. The state Attorney general at a news conference after the verdict and finding Mr. Morrow's guilty jurors rejected his claim that he had left the dog kennels where the crimes occurred several minutes before the shootings. And assertion Mr. Morton made from the witness stand only as a fall back after prosecutors played a video contracting his long standing claim that he had not been there at all. Many long video recording editor channels happen to capture Miss Munoz's voice in the background. It was taken by Paul Model in one of his last living moments act that inadvertently helped to secure the conviction of his father. Prosecutors contended that Mr. Murdoch had killed his son with a shotgun, then gunned down his wife with a rifle when she ran over to see what had happened, prosecutors said Mr. Merdle quickly set about creating alibi, texting and calling his slim wife and visiting his ailing mothers a short drive away. Mr. Mordo stood silently in the courtroom as the verdicts were read. His older son, Buster Marto, who had testified about how distraught his father had been after the killings, sat in the courtroom with a hand over his mouth. The jury also found Mr. Morrow guilty of the two counts of possession of a weapon during the Commission of a violent crime. Judge Clifton Newman said he would sentence Mr. Mordo on Friday morning, the minimum sentence for murder, 30 years in prison, and prosecutors have said they will seek a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of peril. **** Harpootlian, one of Mr. Martin's lawyers, said he planned to appeal the verdict. Would it be possible for us to have summary of his charges and verdicts be ready in 2 weeks? I think 2 week is too much. Let's have them ready within a week. The trial was erecting of Miss Murdoch along avoid legal consequences for his stealing and lying since committed to from the witness stand and as he led a life of privilege and well, in addition to the stolen money, he raking millions of dollars to generate income in some years. As the lawyer for his family's first, Mr. Marlowe once dreamed of following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and great grandfather and becoming the region's top prosecutor. But instead it's a ruling as a volunteer prosecutor working on a handful of cases over 2 decades. Nonetheless, he kept the prosecuted fetch on the dashboard of his card and blue flashing lights installed. Assigned prosecutor said that he viewed himself as above the law. Mr. Murdoch was disbarred last summer after being charged with multiple financial crimes, including the theft in total of about 8.8 million. Mr. Murdoch claimed that he had taken the money to pay for a opioid addiction that was something costing him 10s of thousands of dollars a week. A prosecutor, John Meadors, gave a brief closing argument in rebuttal on Thursday, urging jurors not to believe the claims of innocence that Mister Miller had made from the witness stand. The jury of seven men and five women began deliberating just before 4:00 PM. Vote of having a question from the beginning of the case, prosecutors argued that Mister Marteau committed the killings and fit in a failed effort to gain sympathy and to keep his long time embezzlement from being exposed. But another Mr. Martin's lawyers, Jim Griffin, told jurors on Thursday that the notion that Mister Morrow would try to evade scrutiny of his finances by placing himself in the middle of murder investigation strained credulity. Mr. Griffin, I've seen why, why, why would Alex murder on June 7th, execute his sample and his wife Maggie, who he adored and love? Noting the number of people who know the murder family and testified about their loving relationship creating waters the lead prosecutor noted Mr. Murder admitted on the witness stated that he had told many lies towards the year to cover up his financial misdealings and addiction to painkillers. Metro Waters urged the jurors to avoid becoming the next ones to believe. It's like, he said, don't let him pull you too. Mr. Waters told jurors that a perfect storm had been approaching Mr. Marov, and by extension his wife and son, on the day of the murders. Earlier that day, Mr. Mellon had been confronted by his law firm's financial chief, who accused him of pocketing 6 figure check that he was supposed to pass along to the law firm. That confrontation, Mr. Waters said, was one of the two inquiries into Mr. Martin's finances that led him to fear the walls were closing in. The other was an effort by another large mark B Tinsley, who had sued Mr. Marta over his son's involvement in a drunken boat crashed in 2019 that resulted in in the death of a 19 year old woman. The authorities said the boat was driven by Paul Marto and Mr. Tinsley had been asking a lawyer to force Mr. Mardo to disclose the detailed financial records so that he could go after Mr. Martin's personal assets. Initially, prosecutors said Mr. Munoz scheme worked for several months after the murders. The increase in his finances were holding. But then in September 2021, an employee at his law firm found a missing check in Miss Marvel's office. Leading to the firm's discovery that he had a cycle of millions of dollars, they forced him to run. The next day, in a bizarre series of events, Mr. Murdoch reported that he had been shot in the head on the side of a rural Rd. It turned out, as Mr. Murdoch admitted from a detox facility days later, that he had actually asked a distant cousin, Curtis Eddie Smith, to kill him. Mr. Murdoch said he had wanted to frame his death as a murderer. That so that his surviving son, Buster, could collect on his insurance policy. Much of the trial focused on Mr. Menard's lies, including the one that he repeated to police in three interviews after the murders, in which he claimed to have not been at a family dog kennels. Mr. Morrow made the risky decision to take the witness stand in his own defense last week and said in tearful testimony that he lied to the police because he feared he would become a suspect if he acknowledged being at the kennels that night. He had said he had been there for a few minutes, but then had left and driven to check on his ailing mother, who lived about 15 minutes away. He said he returned about an hour later to find his family dead. Mr. Griffin address Miss Murdoch's initial statements to the police directly on Thursday, saying that the video from the cameras turned out to be the backbone of a case that, like any other evidence but as the longtime drug addict Mr. Murder has become accustomed to telling. Like it then. Mr. Griffin said. Frankly, he probably wouldn't be sitting over here if he hadn't lied, pointing to his client was sat at the defense table in a bronze blazer and white shirt. Intensely watching the proceedings, Mr. Griffin added, he lied because that's what addicts do. Addicts lie. He alive because he had a closet full of skeletons. Throughout the trial, Mr. Murdoch Flyers argued that the police were sloppy in their investigation and had focused almost exclusively on Mr. Murdoch. Instead of looking for other suspects, Mr. Griffin characterized the police investigation as being driven by the concept that useless unless we find someone somebody. It's gonna be Alice. Testimony Mr. Morrow said he believed the killings were probably carried out by someone seeking revenge over the boat crash. Mr. Griffin had ticked through problems in the investigation and his closing arguments, including that the let agents, David Owen of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, gave false testimony about guns found on the property to the grand jurors who indicted Mr. Morrow. He also noted that the police had for months wrongly believed that blood spatter had been found on Mr. Martin's chart, when in fact more rigorous tests taken later showed no blood. He also criticized the prosecution for his contention that murders being consistent. Comments about the timeline of his movements suggested that he was the killer, Mr. Griffin said. Can you imagine what he saw? Choking back tears as he described with Myrtle returning home to find his wife and son? Q He added that, and it's evidence of guilt that he doesn't remember. What the sequence he was in that moment is there evidence of guilt or is there evidence of trauma? But Mr. Waters hammer Mr. Murdoch on his previous deceptions, asking Mr. Maddow repeatedly when he was on the stand if he had looked his client in the eye when he stole their money and sent suggesting that he had. He was also lying to the jury. He's fooled them all, Mr. Waters said. Often victims of Mr. Murdoch descent. He fooled Maggie and Part 2 and they paid for it with their lives. Isn't it tragic that a man from such a well established family put blood on his head? Would have ever imagined. People around him would have been hard to believe. Will there be any movies or documentaries, documentaries being made of the story? Oh, I was certainly watch it if there's going to be 1. By the way, since we were talking about murder and blood and all those kind of stuff. I can't wait for the squid game two to be released. Yeah, I heard it's going to be released later this year. Right. Season one was so fun. I'm finishing the day binge watching was the best. Not going to lie. We get those privileges anymore because all of the work that's piled up in front of us. Moving on to our last agenda item about data centers. Data centers include a room or building IT equipment and facilities to securely cause power and the code equipment. Over the years, data centers have evolved from a location of concentrated IT equipment to modular, agile and highly virtualized compute standards with growing use of web-based services, explosion on mobile devices and every increasing rate of data generation. Dependent for new data center continues to multiple varieties of receiver. One of the main contributors of the growth has been the advance of the cloud computing paradigm, in which cost effectiveness is directly linked to economies of scale and efficiencies. Gained with new data center design. All layer of cloud software and services run on top of physical resources, largely servers, storage and networking equipment, and all of these require power. This equipment also generates heat and so requires cooling. A small data center might fit in one specialized room, while a large installation might be a dedicated warehouse sized facility. Data center design requirements depend on its size and use. Cloud centric data centers could come in two varieties and infrastructure. As a service. Cloud Provider offers a variety of machine types and the customers pick and choose to build their own applications. Software as a service and a platform as a service provider is typically use large scale, homogeneous computer nodes with custom applications that are presented to end users directly. Other types of data centers include enterprise traditional IT, which houses computers to support functions for day-to-day business operations, and high performance computing data centers, which house large clusters of four scientific applications. In the last five years specifically, attention has been paid for the efficiency of ticket centers, dramatically decreasing the operational usage causes and carbon footprint. This increasing efficiency has led to a fast evolution on data center design, and these trends are likely to continue. Effective use of cloud resources and development of large scale, dynamic applications for the cloud require understanding of the physical resources that make up the cloud. In this unit, we start with transient data centers, present components that make up data centers, and discuss data center design considerations and requirements. If you think of the cloud as a massive computer, you can still break it down into its constituent parts, processors, memory, and switch. When you are programming for the cloud, you're writing programs that solve a problem or provide a service, but with the ability to scale. A few decades ago, to be a computer user meant to be a programmer, every programmer knew the instruction set architecture will and because hardware resources were scarce. Scars had to optimize in assembly language. With the advent of high level programming languages such as C&C, Java and Python, why do students still have to learn computer organization, caching and assembly language when you know that the compiler is doing for you and makes you a better programmer because you understand what is going on behind the scenes? Similarly, you become better at debugging unique. How many legal questions are you working on these days? Can you make sure you do 3 questions a day so that you can find a job for the summer? Right, I should be doing so since I'm still jobless for summer. I'll try to do 3 little questions for sure so that I lend anywhere that wants to hire me. Anyway, Fast forward to today. When you are developing applications on the cloud, there does not yet exist a compiler that allocates massive virtualized resources automatically to solve your specific problem. It is up to you, the cloud programmer, to do the management and to make your applications cost efficient at scale, analogous to understanding the components within a single computer. Knowing the underlying components of a data center will improve your abilities to program and debug your cloud based applications. Most of you will never go on to design and build your own large scale. Data center. But understanding what goes into implementing the underlying infrastructure will help you appreciate all things that cloud providers are doing for you. The term data center became popular in 1990s, referring to large rooms dedicated to housing, computing, and the networking equipment, though computer rooms themselves date back much further. Early computers were massive, the size of many refrigerators. They also generate a lot of heat. Energy required clean air refrigeration to increase reliability. For this reason already computer could not be placed into a regular office, so customs rooms were built. A lot of these same ideas go into server rooms today. The only difference is that instead of housing one computer, they hold from dozens to hundreds to even 10s of thousands of servers in a single hostility. So modularity is important for data centers because it allows an organization to expand as needed. One of the enablers of a modular data center has been standardized racks onto which IT equipment is mounted. Historically, server racks have evolved from early relay rats, rats found in railroad signals. It is unclear why the railroad companies chose the original 19 inch post to post width, but the same form factor made its way into early telecommunications and then audio visual equipments at radio and television stations. Some of the advantages of Labrax design over common products. So there's include fire safety where rack posts and other footings were cast out of our and later still this became superior to earlier wooden enclosures that could possibly ignite and damage all equipment inside Nexus feel assembly where racks could be assembled using common hand tools and low skilled workers. Thirdly, regularly spaced holes which is to support a wide variety of equipment. And lastly vertical mounting surface allowing easier installation, maintenance and wiring. Many of today's standard 19 inch equipment racks have evolved from labrax. Sign can dujour prepare a brief diagram of Labour's design? Nothing fancy, just like a simple drawing thing. Yeah, sure, I can do that. Over the past few decades, data centers have growing both in size in terms of the number of racks and cabinets, and intensity. Greater density has become possible because of advances in CPUs, integrated circuit and a printed circuit board design. This leads to faster and more powerful computers within the same area. The minimum size of of an element on an integrated circuit. Or the feature size has become smaller by orders of magnitude over the last four decades. Individual transistors has reduced in size from about 10 microns in 1971 to about 0.022 microns in 2013. Party dividual transistors get smaller. More can speed on the silicon, so each transistor consumes less power. Within the same thermal constraints, CPU's have gone from single core to 16 cores, with transistor counts going from millions to billions. Additionally, accelerators and Co processors have emerged that provide hundreds of additional Floating Points units, each with increasing floating point operation per second per Watt. Also, recent storage arrays have gone from supporting 3 or 4 mechanical hard drives per rack units to 15 to 21 drives per rack unit. Hence, although the power efficiency of individual components has improved over the years, computers themselves have become more dense, packing in more processing cores, memory, and storage per square foot. This density caused the overall power consumption per rack to rise dramatically over the last few years. This trend means that both power and cooling requirements also increase per data center. A large data center now consumes several medical words of power, which is roughly the same power requirements of a small town. Well, that's amazing. So turning data centers are important in terms of cloud computing. Discussion about cloud computing gives me a headache I'm already experiencing. You know, cloud computing stuff in my life. Yeah, let's call it a day. I might faint soon. Have an amazing weekend, everyone else, see you next week. Bye.
