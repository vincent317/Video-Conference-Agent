 something interesting can you all watch the shoe by next week and share your thoughts on it yep producer
 yeah I was gonna watch it anyways soon I just haven't had a chance to find my free time
 okay let's not move on to our next item Alex Myrtle guilty Alex Murdo the first generation lawyer whose family launched their influencing Motown core rooms across part of that Carolina
 was convicted on Thursday of murdering his wife and stuff
 seating the dramatic downfall of a man who has substantial wealth and Powerful connections by The Who Lived a secret life in which he's still millions of dollars from clients and a colleague and life of those closest
 different data the guilty verdicted following a nearly six week long trial more than 20 hour month after the June 2021 fatal shooting of this terminal's wife Maggie 52 and your son Paul 22 on the family Royal Estate
 the grizzly
 crime had a reverberated across the state in part because of the story story history of the marital family which controlled a regional prosecutor's office in South Carolina no country region for more than eight years and ran an influential Law Firm for even longer
 Alan Wilson said today's verdict proof that no one no one no matter who you are in society is above the law the State Attorney General at a news conference after the verdict in finding Mr morto is guilty jurors rejected his claim that he had left the dog kennels where the crimes awkward several minutes before the shootings an assertion Mr mortal made from the witness stand only as a fallback after prosecutors played a video contracting his long-standing claim that he had not been there at all
 the crucial minute long video recorded at the cannot happen to capture miss murdo's voice in the background it was taken by Paul model in one of his last living moment and act that in advertently helped to secure the conviction of his father the prosecutors contented that Mr Murdo had killed his son with a shotgun then gone down his wife with a rifle when she ran over to see what happened
 prosecutors said instrument I'll quickly set about creating Alibi texting and calling his sling wife and visiting his ailing mothers a short drive away
 Mr mordo suit silently in the courtroom as a verdicts were reading his older son Buster Mardo who had testified about how distraut his father had been after the killings sat in the courtroom with the Handover his mouth the jury also found Mr Mardo guilty of the two counts of possession of a weapon doing the commission of a violent crime judge Clifton Newman said he would send his Mr mordo on Friday morning the minimum sentence for murder 30 years in prison and prosecutors have said they will seek a sentence of life in prison without the possible of peril
 dick harpal tillon one of Mr martyr's lawyers said he planned to appeal the verdict would it be possible for us to have summary of his charges and verdicts be ready in two weeks
 I think two weeks is too much let's have them ready within a week
 the trial was erecting Our Miss Murder a lot of oil legal consequences for receiving a lie he committed to from the witness stand and as he led a life of privilege and well in addition to the stolen money he Ricky millions of dollars to January income in some years has the lawyer for his family for Mr Murdo once dreamed of following the full step of his father where father and Greek grandfather and becoming the regional prosecutor
 but instead it's only as the volunteer prosecutor working on a handful of cases over two decades
 nonetheless he kept the prosecuted fetch on the dashboard of his card and Bluetooth flashing lights aside from computer said that he viewed himself as above the law all Mr Myrtle was dispar last summer after being charged with multiple Financial crimes including the theft in total of about 8.8 million Mr amount of claim that he had taken the money to pay for opioid addiction that was something costing him tens of thousands of dollars a week
 a prosecutor John meters gave a brief closing argument in rebutter on Thursday urging Juris not to believe the claims of Innocence that Mr Miller had made from a witness stand
 the jury of seven men and five women began to liberating just before 4 pm
 motive having a question from the beginning of the case prosecutors argued that Mr Mardo committed the killings and fit in a field effort to gain sympathy and to keep his long time embezzlement from being exposed but another mister marto's lawyers Jim Griffin told jurors and Thursday that the notion that Mr Morrow would try to investcrutiny of his finances by placing himself in the middle of murder investigation strain credulity
 Miss equipping I've seen why why would Alex Myrtle on June 7th executed his sample and his wife Maggie who he adore in love
 looking a number of people who know the murder family and testified about their loving relationship
 creatine water the lead prosecutor million Mr model the video on the witness stated that he had told many likes to where the year to cover his financial Miss dealings and addiction to painkillers
 with the waters urges the jurors to avoid becoming the next wise to believe it's like he said don't let him call you too
 Mr Waters told jurors that a perfect storm had been approaching Mr Madoff and by extension his wife and son on the day of the murders
 earlier that day Mr Miller had been confronted by his law firms Financial Chief who accused him of pocketing six-figure check that he was supposed to pass along to the law firm
 that confrontation Mr Waters said was one of the two entries into Mr marto's finances that led him to fear the walls were closing in the other was an effort by another large Mark Bentley who had sued Mr Mardo over his sons involvement in a drunken boat crashed in 2019 that resulted in in the death of a 19 year old woman the authorities that the boat was driven by Paul Mardo and Mr Tinsley had been asking a lawyer to force Mr Mardo to disclose the detailed Financial records so that he could go after Mr morto's personal assets
 initially prosecutors that Mr murals in work for several months after the murders they increase finances were holding but then in September 2021 an employee at his Law Firm found on missing check in Miss murders office
 leading to the firms discovery that he had a title of 10 millions of dollars the first interior
 the next day in a bizarre series of events Mr Madoff reported that he had been shot in the head on the side of the raro roll it turned out as Mr menoff admitted from detox facility days later that he had actually asked a distance cousin Curtis Addie Smith to kill him Mr murder that he had wanted to frame his death as a murderer
 that so that he surviving some Buster could collect on his insurance policy much of the trial focused on instrumentals lies including the one that he repeated to police in three interviews after the murders in which he claimed to have not been at a family dog kennels
 Mr Morrow made the risky decision to take the witness stand and his own defense last week and said in tearful testimony that he lied to the police because he feared he would become a suspect if he acknowledged being at the kennels that night he had said he had been there for a few minutes but then had left and driven to check on his alien mother who lived about 15 minutes away he said he returned about an hour later to find his family dead
 Mr gripping address missed Myrtle's initial statements to the police directly on Thursday thinking that the video from The Canyons funeral to be the backbone of a case that like any other evidence
 but as a long time drug addict Mr Myrtle had become accustomed to tell in life he said
 Mr Griffin said frankly he probably wouldn't be sitting over here if he hadn't lied pointing to his clients who said at a defense table in a bronze Blazer and white shirt intensely watching the proceedings
 Mr Griffin added you lied because that's what addicts do a Dick's lie
 he lied because he had a closet full of skeletons
 throughout the trial Mr Madoff Flyers argued that the police was sloppy in their investigation and had focused almost exclusively on Mr murder instead of looking for other has Suspects
 Mr Griffin characterized the police investigation as being driven by the concept that useless unless we find someone somebody else it's gonna be Alice
 in his testimony Mr Morrow said he believed the killings were probably carried out by someone seeking revenge over the boat crash Mr Griffin had ticked through problems and investigation and his closing arguments including that the lead agents David Owen of the South Carolina law enforcement division gave false testimony about guns found on the property to the Grand jurors who invicted Mr Morrow
 he also noted that the police had for months wrongly believe that blood spatter had been found on Mr Morrow's shirt when in fact more rigorous tests taken later show no blood
 he also criticized the prosecution for his contention that means murdered being consistent comments about the timeline of his movement suggested that he was the Killer
 Mr Griffins then can you imagine what he's doing bacteria as he described Myrtle returning home to finally his wife that sounds cute
 here is that and it's evidence of skills that he doesn't remember was a secret he was in that moment is there evidence of beauty or is that evidence of trump but Mr Waters Hammer Miss America on his previous deceptions asking Mr matto repeatedly when he was understand if he had look his clients in the eye when he stole their money and suggesting that he had he was also lying to the jewelry
 is for them all Mr Waters said of the victims of Mr murdo's descent
 he fought Maggie and part 2 and they paid for it with their lives
 is it a tragic that I meant from such a well-established family put blood on his hand right would have ever imagined people around him would have been hardly
 will there be any movies or documents documentaries being made off the story
 oh I was certainly watch it if there's gonna be one by the way since we were talking about murder and blood and all those kind of stuff I can't wait for this quit game too to be released yeah I heard it's gonna be released lady here
 right season one was so fun I finish in the day binge watching was the best not gonna lie
 sad that we don't get those privileges anymore because all of the work that's piled up in front of us
 moving on to our last agenda items about data centers it doesn't interest include a room or building it equipment and Facilities to purely cause power and the code that equipment over the years later centers have evolved from our location on concentrated IQ equipment to modular agile and the highly virtualized compute standards with green use of weapons Services explosion on mobile device and every increasing rate located generation and on the defendant for you one of the main contributors of the growth has been the Advent of the cloud computing paradigm
 in which cost-effectiveness is directly linked to economies of scale and a efficiencies
 gained with new data center design
 all layer of cloud software and services run on top of physical resources largely servers storage and networking equipments
 and all of these require power this equipment also generates heat and so requires Cooling
 a small data center my fitting one specialized room while a large installation might be a dedicated Warehouse sized facility
 data center design requirements depend on its size and use cloudcentric data centers could come in two varieties and infrastructure as a service cloud is provider offers a variety of machine types and the customers pick and choose to build their own applications
 software has a service and a platform as a service providers typically use large scale homogeneous compute nodes with custom applications that are presented to end users directly
 other types of data centers include Enterprise traditional it which houses computers to support functions for day-to-day business operations and high performance Computing data centers which house large clusters of four scientific applications
 in the last five years specific attention has been paid for the visions of data centers dramatically decreasing the operational usage causes and carbon footprint
 this increasing efficiency has led to a fast Evolution on data center design and these Trends are likely to continue in fact the use of cloud resources and development of large scale Dynamic applications for the cloud require understanding of the physical resources that make up the cloud
 in this unit we start with trending data centers present components that make up a data centers and discuss data center design considerations and requirements you if you think of the clown as a massive computer you can still break it down into its constituent Parts processors memory and switch when you are programming for the cloud you're writing programs that solve a problem or provide a service but with the ability to scale a few decades ago should be a computer user meant to be a programmer every program I knew the instruction set architecture will and because Hardware resources were scared
 scars had to optimize your Assembly Language with the Advent of high-level programming languages such as C and c++, Java and python why do students still have to learn computer organization caching and Assembly Language
 when you know that the compiler is doing for you and makes you a better programmer because you understand what is going on behind the scenes
 similarly you become better at debugging
 unique how many difficult questions are you working on these days can you make sure you do three questions a day so that you can find a job for the summer
 right I should be doing so since I'm still jobless for summer I'll try to do three let go questions for sure so that I lend anywhere that wants to hire me
 anyway fast forward to today when you are developing applications on the cloud there does not yet exist a compiler that allocates massive virtualized resources automatically to solve your specific problem it is up to you the cloud programmer to do the management and to make your applications cost efficient at scale analogous to understanding the components within a single computer knowing the underlying components of a data center will improve your abilities to program and debug your college-based applications most of you will never go on to design and build your own large scale data center but understanding what goes into implementing the underline infrastructure will help you appreciate all things that cloud providers are doing for you
 the term data center became popular in 1990s referring to large rooms dedicated to housing Computing and the networking equipment
 though computer rooms themselves date back much further early computers were massive the size of many refrigerator they also generate a lot of heat energy required clean air Refrigeration we increase reliability
 for this reason early computer could not be placed into a regular office so Customs rooms were built a lot of these team ideas go into servers today the only difference is that instead of housing one computer they hold from dozens to hundreds to even tens of thousands of serving a single utility
 Better Learning so modularity is important for data centers because it allows and organization to expand as needed why not be enablers of a modular data center has been standardized racks onto which it equipment is mounted
 historically server racks have evolved for early relate rats rats fun in railroad signaling
 it is unclear why the real world companies chose the original 19 inch post your post with but the same form factor made it's way into early telecommunications and then audio visual equipments and radio and television stations
 some of the advantages of LAB Works design over common protest
 serves include a fire safety where rack posts and other footings were cast out of iron in later still this became Superior to earlier wouldn't enclosures that could possibly ignite and damage all equipment inside Nexus feel assembly where wax could be assembled using common hand tools and low skill workers thirdly regularly spaced holes which is to support a wide variety of equipment and lastly vertical mounting surface allowing easier installation maintenance and wiring many of today standard 19 inch equipment racks have evolved from labyrinx design can touch your prepare a brief diagram of LAB Works design nothing fancy just like a simple drawing thing yeah sure I could do that over the past few decades do this and there's have growing boating inside in terms of the number of Iraq and intensity
 Twitter density has become possible because of advances in CPUs integral circuit and a printed circuit board design this leads to faster and more powerful computers within the same area the minimum size of an element are integrated circuit called the feature size has become smaller by others of magnitude over the last four decades
 individual transistors has reduced inside from about 10 microns in 1971 to about 0.022 micros in 2014
 but individual transistors get smaller more can fiddle victims silicon
 so each transistor consumes less power waiting the same thermal constraints CPUs have gone from single quarter 16 cores with transistor counts going from Millions to billions additionally accelerators and Co processors have emerged that provide hundreds of additional floating points units each with increasing floating Point operation per second per wants also recent storage arrays have gone from supporting three or four mechanical hard drive units to 15 to 21 drives perfect
 and so though the power efficiency of individual components has improved over the years computers themselves have become more dense packing in more processing course memory and storage per square foot this density caused the overall power consumption proact to rise dramatically over the last few years this trend means that both power and cooling requirements also increase per data center a large data center now consumes several medical power which is roughly the same power requirements of a small town
 well that's amazing they're doing data centers are important in terms of cloud computing
 discussing about call Computing gives me a headache and already experiencing you know cloud computing stuff in my life
 yeah let's call it a day on my face soon have an amazing weekend everyone else see you next week bye
