 into
 mr

 led
 him

 mr

 to
 disclose
 the
 detailed
 financial
 records
 so
 that
 he
 could
 go
 after
 mr

 is
 personal

 initially
 prosecutors
 that
 mr
 murals
 in
 work
 for
 several
 months
 after
 the

 the
 firms
 discovery
 that
 he
 had
 a
 title
 of
 10
 millions
 of

 the
 first
 interior
 the
 next
 day
 in
 a
 bizarre
 series
 of
 events
 mr
 madoff
 reported
 that
 he
 had
 been
 shot
 in
 the
 head
 on
 the
 side
 of
 the
 raro
 roll
 it
 turned
 out
 as
 mr
 menoff
 admitted
 from
 detox
 facility
 days
 later
 that
 he
 had
 actually
 asked
 a
 distance
 cousin
 curtis
 addie
 smith
 to
 kill
 him
 mr
 murder
 that
 he
 had
 wanted
 to
 frame
 his
 death
 as
 a
 murderer
 that
 so
 that
 he
 surviving
 some
 buster
 could
 collect
 on
 his
 insurance
 policy
 much
 of
 the
 trial
 focused
 on
 instrumentals
 lies
 including
 the
 one
 that
 he
 repeated
 to
 police
 in
 three
 interviews
 after
 the
 murders
 in
 which
 he
 claimed
 to
 have
 not
 been
 at
 a
 family
 dog
 kennels
 mr
 morrow
 made
 the
 risky
 decision
 to
 take
 the
 witness
 stand
 and
 his
 own
 defense
 last
 week
 and
 said
 in
 tearful
 testimony
 that
 he
 lied
 to
 the
 police
 because
 he
 feared
 he
 would
 become
 a
 suspect
 if
 he
 acknowledged
 being
 at
 the
 kennels
 that
 night
 he
 had
 said
 he
 had
 been
 there
 for
 a
 few
 minutes
 but
 then
 had
 left
 and
 driven
 to
 check
 on
 his
 alien
 mother
 who
 lived
 about
 15
 minutes
 away
 he
 said
 he
 returned
 about
 an
 hour
 later
 to
 find
 his
 family
 dead
 mr
 gripping
 address
 missed
 myrtle
 is
 initial
 statements
 to
 the
 police
 directly
 on
 thursday
 thinking
 that
 the
 video
 from
 the
 canyons
 funeral
 to
 be
 the
 backbone
 of
 a
 case
 that
 like
 any
 other
 evidence
 but
 as
 a
 long
 time
 drug
 addict
 mr
 myrtle
 had
 become
 accustomed
 to
 tell
 in
 life
 he
 said
 mr
 griffin
 said
 frankly
 he
 probably
 would
 not
 be
 sitting
 over
 here
 if
 he
 had
 not
 lied
 pointing
 to
 his
 clients
 who
 said
 at
 a
 defense
 table
 in
 a
 bronze
 blazer
 and
 white
 shirt
 intensely
 watching
 the
 proceedings
 mr
 griffin
 added
 you
 lied
 because
 that
 is
 what
 addicts
 do
 a
 dick
 is
 lie
 he
 lied
 because
 he
 had
 a
 closet
 full
 of
 skeletons
 throughout
 the
 trial
 mr
 madoff
 flyers
 argued
 that
 the
 police
 was
 sloppy
 in
 their
 investigation
 and
 had
 focused
 almost
 exclusively
 on
 mr
 murder
 instead
 of
 looking
 for
 other
 has
 suspects
 mr
 griffin
 characterized
 the
 police
 investigation
 as
 being
 driven
 by
 the
 concept
 that
 useless
 unless
 we
 find
 someone
 somebody
 else
 it
 is
 gonna
 be
 alice
 in
 his
 testimony
 mr
 morrow
 said
 he
 believed
 the
 killings
 were
 probably
 carried
 out
 by
 someone
 seeking
 revenge
 over
 the
 boat
 crash
 mr
 griffin
 had
 ticked
 through
 problems
 and
 investigation
 and
 his
 closing
 arguments
 including
 that
 the
 lead
 agents
 david
 owen
 of
 the
 south
 carolina
 law
 enforcement
 division
 gave
 false
 testimony
 about
 guns
 found
 on
 the
 property
 to
 the
 grand
 jurors
 who
 invicted
 mr
 morrow
 he
 also
 noted
 that
 the
 police
 had
 for
 months
 wrongly
 believe
 that
 blood
 spatter
 had
 been
 found
 on
 mr
 morrow
 is
 shirt
 when
 in
 fact
 more
 rigorous
 tests
 taken
 later
 show
 no
 blood
 he
 also
 criticized
 the
 prosecution
 for
 his
 contention
 that
 means
 murdered
 being
 consistent
 comments
 about
 the
 timeline
 of
 his
 movement
 suggested
 that
 he
 was
 the
 killer
 mr
 griffins
 then
 can
 you
 imagine
 what
 he
 is
 doing
 bacteria
 as
 he
 described
 myrtle
 returning
 home
 to
 finally
 his
 wife
 that
 sounds
 cute
 here
 is
 that
 and
 it
 is
 evidence
 of
 skills
 that
 he
 does
 not
 remember
 was
 a
 secret
 he
 was
 in
 that
 moment
 is
 there
 evidence
 of
 beauty
 or
 is
 that
 evidence
 of
 trump
 but
 mr
 waters
 hammer
 miss
 america
 on
 his
 previous
 deceptions
 asking
 mr
 matto
 repeatedly
 when
 he
 was
 understand
 if
 he
 had
 look
 his
 clients
 in
 the
 eye
 when
 he
 stole
 their
 money
 and
 suggesting
 that
 he
 had
 he
 was
 also
 lying
 to
 the
 jewelry
 is
 for
 them
 all
 mr
 waters
 said
 of
 the
 victims
 of
 mr
 murdo
 is
 descent
 he
 fought
 maggie
 and
 part
 2
 and
 they
 paid
 for
 it
 with
 their
 lives
 is
 it
 a
 tragic
 that
 i
 meant
 from
 such
 a
 wellestablished
 family
 put
 blood
 on
 his
 hand
 right
 would
 have
 ever
 imagined
 people
 around
 him
 would
 have
 been
 hardly
 will
 there
 be
 any
 movies
 or
 documents
 documentaries
 being
 made
 off
 the
 story
 oh
 i
 was
 certainly
 watch
 it
 if
 there
 is
 gonna
 be
 one
 by
 the
 way
 since
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 murder
 and
 blood
 and
 all
 those
 kind
 of
 stuff
 i
 can
 not
 wait
 for
 this
 quit
 game
 too
 to
 be
 released

 heard
 it
 is
 gonna
 be
 released
 lady
 here

 the
 day
 binge
 watching

 the
 best
 not
 gonna
 lie
 sad

 all
 of
 the
 work

 piled
 up
 in
 front
 of
 us
 moving
 on
 to
 our
 last
 agenda
 items
 about
 data
 centers
 it
 does
 not
 interest
 include
 a
 room
 or
 building
 it
 equipment
 and
 facilities
 to
 purely
 cause
 power
 and
 the
 code
 that
 equipment
 over
 the
 years
 later
 centers
 have
 evolved
 from
 our
 location
 on
 concentrated
 iq
 equipment
 to
 modular
 agile

 the
 highly
 virtualized

 standards
 with
 green
 use
 of

 explosion
 on

 and
 every
 increasing
 rate
 located
 generation
 and
 on
 the
 defendant
 for
 you
 one
 of
 the
 main
 contributors
 of
 the
 growth
 has
 been
 the
 advent
 of
 the
 cloud

 all

 of
 cloud
 software
 and

 run
 on
 top
 of
 physical

 largely
 servers
 storage

 networking
 equipments
 and
 all
 of
 these
 require

 data

 design
 requirements
 depend
 on
 its
 size
 and
 use
 cloudcentric
 data
 centers
 could
 come
 in
 two
 varieties
 and
 infrastructure
 as
 a
 service
 cloud
 is
 provider
 offers
 a
 variety
 of
 machine
 types
 and
 the
 customers
 pick
 and
 choose
 to
 build
 their
 own
 applications
 software
 has
 a
 service
 and
 a
 platform
 as
 a
 service
 providers
 typically
 use
 large
 scale
 homogeneous
 compute
 nodes
 with
 custom
 applications
 that
 are
 presented
 to
 end
 users
 directly
 other
 types
 of
 data
 centers
 include
 enterprise
 traditional
 it
 which
 houses
 computers
 to
 support
 functions
 for
 daytoday
 business
 operations
 and
 high
 performance
 computing
 data
 centers
 which
 house
 large
 clusters
 of
 four
 scientific
 applications
 in
 the
 last
 five
 years
 specific
 attention
 has
 been
 paid
 for
 the
 visions
 of
 data
 centers
 dramatically
 decreasing
 the
 operational
 usage
 causes
 and
 carbon
 footprint
 this
 increasing
 efficiency
 has
 led
 to
 a
 fast
 evolution
 on
 data
 center
 design
 and
 these
 trends
 are
 likely
 to
 continue
 in
 fact
 the
 use
 of
 cloud
 resources
 and
 development
 of
 large
 scale
 dynamic
 applications
 for
 the
 cloud
 require
 understanding
 of
 the
 physical
 resources
 that
 make
 up
 the
 cloud
 in
 this
 unit
 we
 start
 with
 trending
 data
 centers
 present
 components
 that
 make
 up
 a
 data
 centers
 and
 discuss
 data
 center
 design
 considerations
 and
 requirements
 you
 if
 you
 think
 of
 the
 clown
 as
 a
 massive
 computer
 you
 can
 still
 break
 it
 down
 into
 its
 constituent
 parts
 processors
 memory
 and
 switch
 when
 you
 are
 programming
 for
 the
 cloud
 you
 are
 writing
 programs
 that
 solve
 a
 problem
 or
 provide
 a
 service
 but
 with
 the
 ability
 to
 scale
 a
 few
 decades
 ago
 should
 be
 a
 computer
 user
 meant
 to
 be
 a
 programmer
 every
 program
 i
 knew
 the
 instruction
 set
 architecture
 will
 and
 because
 hardware
 resources
 were
 scared
 scars
 had
 to
 optimize
 your
 assembly
 language
 with
 the
 advent
 of
 highlevel
 programming
 languages
 such
 as
 c
 and
 c++
 java
 and
 python
 why
 do
 students
 still
 have
 to
 learn
 computer
 organization
 caching
 and
 assembly
 language
 when
 you
 know
 that
 the
 compiler
 is
 doing
 for
 you
 and
 makes
 you
 a
 better
 programmer
 because
 you
 understand
 what
 is
 going
 on
 behind
 the
 scenes
 similarly
 you
 become
 better
 at
 debugging
 unique
 how
 many
 difficult
 questions
 are
 you
 working
 on
 these
 days
 can
 you
 make
 sure
 you
 do
 three
 questions
 a
 day
 so
 that
 you
 can
 find
 a
 job
 for
 the
 summer
 right
 i
 should
 be
 doing
 so
 since
 i
 am
 still
 jobless
 for
 summer
 i
 will
 try
 to
 do
 three
 let
 go
 questions
 for
 sure
 so
 that
 i
 lend
 anywhere
 that
 wants
 to
 hire
 me
 anyway
 fast
 forward
 to
 today
 when
 you
 are
 developing
 applications
 on
 the
 cloud
 there
 does
 not
 yet
 exist
 a
 compiler
 that
 allocates
 massive
 virtualized
 resources
 automatically
 to
 solve
 your
 specific
 problem
 it
 is
 up
 to
 you
 the
 cloud
 programmer
 to
 do
 the
 management
 and
 to
 make
 your
 applications
 cost
 efficient
 at
 scale
 analogous
 to
 understanding
 the
 components
 within
 a
 single
 computer
 knowing
 the
 underlying
 components
 of
 a
 data
 center
 will
 improve
 your
 abilities
 to
 program
 and
 debug
 your
 collegebased
 applications
 most
 of
 you
 will
 never
 go
 on
 to
 design
 and
 build
 your
 own
 large
 scale
 data
 center
 but
 understanding
 what
 goes
 into
 implementing
 the
 underline
 infrastructure
 will
 help
 you
 appreciate
 all
 things
 that
 cloud
 providers
 are
 doing
 for
 you
 the
 term
 data
 center
 became
 popular
 in
 1990s
 referring
 to
 large
 rooms
 dedicated
 to
 housing
 computing
 and
 the
 networking
 equipment
 though
 computer
 rooms
 themselves
 date
 back
 much
 further
 early
 computers
 were
 massive
 the
 size
 of
 many
 refrigerator
 they
 also
 generate
 a
 lot
 of
 heat
 energy
 required
 clean
 air
 refrigeration
 we
 increase
 reliability
 for
 this
 reason
 early
 computer
 could
 not
 be
 placed
 into
 a
 regular
 office
 so
 customs
 rooms
 were
 built
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 team
 ideas
 go
 into
 servers
 today
 the
 only
 difference
 is
 that
 instead
 of
 housing
 one
 computer
 they
 hold
 from
 dozens
 to
 hundreds
 to
 even
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 serving
 a
 single
 utility
 better
 learning
 so
 modularity
 is
 important
 for
 data
 centers
 because
 it
 allows
 and
 organization
 to
 expand
 as
 needed
 why
 not

 has
 become
 possible
 because
 of
 advances
 in

 this
 leads
 to

 computers
 within
 the

 the

 circuit
 called
 the

 become

 by
 others

 over
 the
 last
 four
 decades
 individual

 has
 reduced

 from
 about
 10

 in
 1971
 to
 about
 0022

 in

 but
 individual

 get
 smaller

 so
 each

 cpus
 have
 gone
 from

 cores
 with
 transistor

 going
 from
 millions
 to
 billions
 additionally
 accelerators
 and
 co
 processors
 have
 emerged
 that
 provide
 hundreds
 of
 additional
 floating

 units
 each
 with
 increasing
 floating

 operation
 per

 per

 also
 recent

 have
 gone
 from

 to
 15
 to
 21
 drives
 perfect
 and
 so
 though
 the
 power
 efficiency
 of
 individual
 components
 has
 improved
 over
 the
 years
 computers
 themselves
 have
 become
 more
 dense
 packing
 in
 more
 processing
 course
 memory
 and
 storage
 per
 square
 foot
 this
 density
 caused
 the
 overall
 power
 consumption
 proact
 to
 rise
 dramatically
 over
 the
 last
 few
 years
 this
 trend
 means
 that
 both
 power
 and
 cooling
 requirements
 also
 increase

 which
 is
 roughly

 well
 that
 is
 amazing
 they
 are
 doing
 data
 centers
 are
 important
 in
 terms
 of
 cloud
 computing
 discussing
 about
 call
 computing
 gives
 me
 a
 headache
 and
 already
 experiencing
 you
 know
 cloud
 computing
 stuff
 in
 my
 life
 yeah
 let
 us
 call
 it
 a
 day
 on

 soon
 have
 an
 amazing

 everyone
 else
 see
 you
 next
