 sad
 the

 followed
 reporting
 british

 the

 from
 the

 which
 is
 owned

 it
 had
 since
 been
 offered
 to
 prince
 andrew
 one
 of
 king
 charles
 3
 is
 brother
 buckingham
 palace
 said
 wednesday
 it
 would
 be
 offering
 no
 comment
 a
 royal
 source
 told
 cnn
 that
 any
 such
 discussions
 would
 be
 a
 private
 family
 matter
 prince
 harry
 and
 meghan
 now
 reside
 in
 the
 united
 states
 but
 have
 retained
 the
 early
 19th
 century
 property
 as
 a
 uk
 base
 gifted
 to
 the
 sussex
 is
 by
 the
 late
 queen
 elizabeth
 third
 the
 second
 the
 cottage
 is
 nestled
 in
 14
 of
 the
 windsors
 estate
 west
 of
 london
 they
 refurbished
 the
 property
 and
 moved
 in
 shortly
 before
 the
 arrival
 of
 their
 son
 archie
 in
 may
 not
 2019
 however
 the
 renovation
 sparked
 controversy
 after
 the

 stepped
 back
 from
 public
 life
 and
 it
 emerged
 about
 $3
 million
 of
 british
 taxpayers
 money
 had
 been
 used
 under
 cottage
 refurbishments
 they
 have
 since
 paid
 back
 the
 public
 money
 following
 their

 like
 loyal
 life
 something
 that
 i
 definitely
 wanted
 to
 try
 out

 be
 amazing
 works

 the
 removal
 of

 refinishing
 the
 roof
 new
 staircases
 fireplace
 installations
 and
 new
 floating
 wooden
 floor
 with
 detailing
 planning
 application
 documents
 to

 console
 because
 of
 all
 fittings

 need

 several
 minutes
 before

 and
 assertion
 mr

 following
 in
 the
 footsteps
 of
 his
 father
 grandfather
 and
 great
 grandfather
 and
 becoming
 the
 region
 is
 top
 prosecutor
 but
 instead
 it
 is
 a
 ruling
 as
 a
 volunteer
 prosecutor
 working
 on
 a
 handful
 of
 cases
 over
 2
 decades
 nonetheless
 he
 kept
 the
 prosecuted
 fetch
 on
 the
 dashboard
 of
 his

 and
 blue
 flashing

 installed
 assigned

 not
 to
 believe
 the
 claims
 of
 innocence
 that
 mister

 had
 made
 from
 the
 witness
 stand
 the

 of
 seven
 men
 and
 five
 women
 began
 deliberating
 just
 before
 400
 pm
 vote
 of
 having
 a
 question
 from
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 case
 prosecutors
 argued
 that
 mister
 marteau
 committed
 the
 killings
 and
 fit
 in
 a
 failed
 effort
 to
 gain
 sympathy
 and
 to
 keep
 his
 long
 time
 embezzlement
 from
 being
 exposed
 but
 another
 mr
 martin
 is
 lawyers
 jim
 griffin
 told
 jurors
 on
 thursday
 that
 the
 notion
 that
 mister
 morrow
 would
 try
 to
 evade
 scrutiny
 of
 his
 finances
 by
 placing
 himself
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 murder
 investigation
 strained
 credulity
 mr
 griffin
 i
 have
 seen
 why
 why
 why
 would
 alex
 murder
 on
 june
 7th
 execute
 his
 sample
 and
 his
 wife
 maggie
 who
 he
 adored
 and
 love
 noting
 the
 number
 of
 people
 who
 know
 the
 murder
 family
 and
 testified
 about
 their
 loving
 relationship
 creating
 waters
 the
 lead
 prosecutor
 noted
 mr
 murder
 admitted
 on
 the
 witness

 that
 he
 had
 told
 many
 lies
 towards
 the
 year
 to
 cover
 up
 his
 financial
 misdealings
 and
 addiction
 to
 painkillers
 metro
 waters
 urged
 the
 jurors
 to
 avoid
 becoming
 the
 next
 ones
 to
 believe
 it
 is
 like
 he
 said
 do
 not
 let
 him
 pull
 you
 too
 mr
 waters
 told
 jurors
 that
 a
 perfect
 storm
 had
 been
 approaching
 mr
 marov
 and
 by
 extension
 his
 wife
 and
 son
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 murders
 earlier
 that
 day
 mr
 mellon
 had
 been
 confronted
 by
 his
 law
 firm
 is
 financial
 chief
 who
 accused
 him
 of
 pocketing
 6
 figure
 check
 that
 he
 was
 supposed
 to
 pass
 along
 to
 the
 law
 firm
 that
 confrontation
 mr
 waters
 said
 was
 one
 of
 the
 two
 inquiries
 into
 mr
 martin
 is
 finances
 that
 led
 him
 to
 fear
 the
 walls
 were
 closing
 in
 the
 other
 was
 an
 effort
 by
 another
 large
 mark
 b
 tinsley
 who
 had
 sued
 mr
 marta
 over
 his
 son
 is
 involvement
 in
 a
 drunken
 boat
 crashed
 in
 2019
 that
 resulted
 in
 in
 the
 death
 of
 a
 19
 year
 old
 woman
 the
 authorities
 said
 the
 boat
 was
 driven
 by
 paul
 marto
 and
 mr
 tinsley
 had
 been
 asking
 a
 lawyer
 to
 force
 mr
 mardo
 to
 disclose
 the
 detailed
 financial
 records
 so
 that
 he
 could
 go
 after
 mr
 martin
 is
 personal
 assets
 initially
 prosecutors
 said
 mr
 munoz
 scheme
 worked
 for
 several
 months
 after
 the
 murders
 the
 increase
 in
 his
 finances
 were
 holding
 but
 then
 in
 september
 2021
 an
 employee
 at
 his
 law
 firm
 found
 a
 missing
 check
 in
 miss
 marvel
 is
 office
 leading
 to
 the
 firm
 is
 discovery
 that
 he
 had
 a
 cycle
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 they
 forced
 him
 to
 run
 the
 next
 day
 in
 a
 bizarre
 series
 of
 events
 mr
 murdoch
 reported
 that
 he
 had
 been
 shot
 in
 the
 head
 on
 the
 side
 of
 a
 rural
 rd
 it
 turned
 out
 as
 mr
 murdoch
 admitted
 from
 a
 detox
 facility
 days
 later
 that
 he
 had
 actually
 asked
 a
 distant
 cousin
 curtis
 eddie
 smith
 to
 kill
 him
 mr
 murdoch
 said
 he
 had
 wanted
 to
 frame
 his
 death
 as
 a
 murderer
 that
 so
 that
 his
 surviving
 son
 buster
 could
 collect
 on
 his
 insurance
 policy
 much
 of
 the
 trial
 focused
 on
 mr
 menard
 is
 lies
 including
 the
 one
 that
 he
 repeated
 to
 police
 in
 three
 interviews
 after
 the
 murders
 in
 which
 he
 claimed
 to
 have
 not
 been
 at
 a
 family
 dog
 kennels
 mr
 morrow
 made
 the
 risky
 decision
 to
 take
 the
 witness
 stand
 in
 his
 own
 defense
 last
 week
 and
 said
 in
 tearful
 testimony
 that
 he
 lied
 to
 the
 police
 because
 he
 feared
 he
 would
 become
 a
 suspect
 if
 he
 acknowledged
 being
 at
 the
 kennels
 that
 night
 he
 had
 said
 he
 had
 been
 there
 for
 a
 few
 minutes
 but
 then
 had
 left
 and
 driven
 to
 check
 on
 his
 ailing
 mother
 who
 lived
 about
 15
 minutes
 away
 he
 said
 he
 returned
 about
 an
 hour
 later
 to
 find
 his
 family
 dead
 mr
 griffin
 address
 miss
 murdoch
 is
 initial
 statements
 to
 the
 police
 directly
 on
 thursday
 saying
 that
 the
 video
 from
 the
 cameras
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 the
 backbone
 of
 a
 case
 that
 like
 any
 other
 evidence
 but
 as
 the
 longtime
 drug
 addict
 mr
 murder
 has
 become
 accustomed
 to
 telling
 like
 it
 then
 mr
 griffin
 said
 frankly
 he
 probably
 would
 not
 be
 sitting
 over
 here
 if
 he
 had
 not
 lied
 pointing
 to
 his
 client
 was
 sat
 at
 the
 defense
 table
 in
 a
 bronze
 blazer
 and
 white
 shirt
 intensely
 watching
 the
 proceedings
 mr
 griffin
 added
 he
 lied
 because
 that
 is
 what
 addicts
 do
 addicts
 lie
 he
 alive
 because
 he
 had
 a
 closet
 full
 of
 skeletons
 throughout
 the
 trial
 mr
 murdoch
 flyers
 argued
 that
 the
 police
 were
 sloppy
 in
 their
 investigation
 and
 had
 focused
 almost
 exclusively
 on
 mr
 murdoch
 instead
 of
 looking
 for
 other
 suspects
 mr
 griffin
 characterized
 the
 police
 investigation
 as
 being
 driven
 by
 the
 concept
 that
 useless
 unless
 we
 find
 someone
 somebody
 it
 is
 gonna
 be
 alice
 testimony
 mr
 morrow
 said
 he
 believed
 the
 killings
 were
 probably
 carried
 out
 by
 someone
 seeking
 revenge
 over
 the
 boat
 crash
 mr
 griffin
 had
 ticked
 through
 problems
 in
 the
 investigation
 and
 his
 closing
 arguments
 including
 that
 the
 let
 agents
 david
 owen
 of
 the
 south
 carolina
 law
 enforcement
 division
 gave
 false
 testimony
 about
 guns
 found
 on
 the
 property
 to
 the
 grand
 jurors
 who
 indicted
 mr
 morrow
 he
 also
 noted
 that
 the
 police
 had
 for
 months
 wrongly
 believed
 that
 blood
 spatter
 had
 been
 found
 on
 mr
 martin
 is
 chart
 when
 in
 fact
 more
 rigorous
 tests
 taken
 later
 showed
 no
 blood
 he
 also
 criticized
 the
 prosecution
 for
 his
 contention
 that
 murders
 being
 consistent
 comments
 about
 the
 timeline
 of
 his
 movements
 suggested
 that
 he
 was
 the
 killer
 mr
 griffin
 said
 can
 you
 imagine
 what
 he
 saw
 choking
 back
 tears
 as
 he
 described
 with
 myrtle
 returning
 home
 to
 find
 his
 wife
 and
 son
 q
 he
 added
 that
 and
 it
 is
 evidence
 of
 guilt
 that
 he
 does
 not
 remember
 what
 the
 sequence
 he
 was
 in
 that
 moment
 is
 there
 evidence
 of
 guilt
 or
 is
 there
 evidence
 of
 trauma
 but
 mr
 waters
 hammer
 mr
 murdoch
 on
 his
 previous
 deceptions
 asking
 mr
 maddow
 repeatedly
 when
 he
 was
 on
 the
 stand
 if
 he
 had
 looked
 his
 client
 in
 the
 eye
 when
 he
 stole
 their
 money
 and
 sent
 suggesting
 that
 he
 had
 he
 was
 also
 lying
 to
 the
 jury
 he
 is
 fooled
 them
 all
 mr
 waters
 said
 often
 victims
 of
 mr
 murdoch
 descent
 he
 fooled
 maggie
 and
 part
 2
 and
 they
 paid
 for
 it
 with
 their
 lives
 is
 not
 it
 tragic
 that
 a
 man
 from
 such
 a
 well
 established
 family
 put
 blood
 on
 his
 head
 would
 have
 ever
 imagined
 people
 around
 him
 would
 have
 been
 hard
 to
 believe
 will
 there
 be
 any
 movies
 or
 documentaries
 documentaries
 being
 made
 of
 the
 story
 oh
 i
 was
 certainly
 watch
 it
 if
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 1
 by
 the
 way
 since
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 murder
 and
 blood
 and
 all
 those
 kind
 of
 stuff
 i
 can
 not
 wait
 for
 the
 squid
 game
 two
 to
 be
 released
 yeah
 i
 heard
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 released
 later
 this
 year
 right
 season

 so
 fun
 i
 am
 finishing
 the
 day
 binge
 watching
 was
 the
 best
 not
 going
 to
 lie

 get
 those
 privileges
 anymore
 because
 all
 of
 the
 work
 that

 piled
 up
 in
 front
 of
 us
 moving
 on
 to
 our
 last
 agenda
 item
 about
 data
 centers
 data
 centers
 include
 a
 room
 or
 building
 it
 equipment
 and
 facilities
 to
 securely
 cause
 power
 and
 the
 code
 equipment
 over
 the
 years
 data
 centers
 have
 evolved
 from
 a
 location
 of
 concentrated
 it
 equipment
 to
 modular
 agile
 and
 highly
 virtualized
 compute
 standards
 with
 growing
 use
 of
 webbased

 on

 every

 one
 of
 the
 main
 contributors
 of
 the
 growth
 has
 been
 the
 advance
 of
 the
 cloud
 computing
 paradigm
 in
 which
 cost
 effectiveness
 is
 directly
 linked
 to
 economies
 of
 scale
 and
 efficiencies
 gained
 with
 new
 data
 center
 design
 all
 layer
 of
 cloud
 software
 and
 services
 run
 on
 top
 of
 physical
 resources
 largely
 servers
 storage
 and
 networking
 equipment
 and
 all
 of
 these
 require
 power
 this
 equipment
 also
 generates
 heat
 and
 so
 requires
 cooling
 a
 small
 data
 center
 might
 fit
 in
 one
 specialized
 room
 while
 a
 large
 installation
 might
 be
 a
 dedicated
 warehouse
 sized
 facility
 data
 center
 design
 requirements
 depend
 on
 its
 size
 and
 use
 cloud
 centric
 data
 centers
 could
 come
 in
 two
 varieties
 and
 infrastructure
 as
 a
 service
 cloud
 provider
 offers
 a
 variety
 of
 machine
 types
 and
 the
 customers
 pick
 and
 choose
 to
 build
 their
 own
 applications
 software
 as
 a
 service
 and
 a
 platform
 as
 a
 service
 provider
 is
 typically
 use
 large
 scale
 homogeneous
 computer
 nodes
 with
 custom
 applications
 that
 are
 presented
 to
 end
 users
 directly
 other
 types
 of
 data
 centers
 include
 enterprise
 traditional
 it
 which
 houses
 computers
 to
 support
 functions
 for
 daytoday
 business
 operations
 and
 high
 performance
 computing
 data
 centers
 which
 house
 large
 clusters
 of
 four
 scientific
 applications
 in
 the
 last
 five
 years
 specifically
 attention
 has
 been
 paid
 for
 the
 efficiency
 of
 ticket
 centers
 dramatically
 decreasing
 the
 operational
 usage
 causes
 and
 carbon
 footprint
 this
 increasing
 efficiency
 has
 led
 to
 a
 fast
 evolution
 on
 data
 center
 design
 and
 these
 trends
 are
 likely
 to
 continue
 effective
 use
 of
 cloud
 resources
 and
 development
 of
 large
 scale
 dynamic
 applications
 for
 the
 cloud
 require
 understanding
 of
 the
 physical
 resources
 that
 make
 up
 the
 cloud
 in
 this
 unit
 we
 start
 with
 transient
 data
 centers
 present
 components
 that
 make
 up
 data
 centers
 and
 discuss
 data
 center
 design
 considerations
 and
 requirements
 if
 you
 think
 of
 the
 cloud
 as
 a
 massive
 computer
 you
 can
 still
 break
 it
 down
 into
 its
 constituent
 parts
 processors
 memory
 and
 switch
 when
 you
 are
 programming
 for
 the
 cloud
 you
 are
 writing
 programs
 that
 solve
 a
 problem
 or
 provide
 a
 service
 but
 with
 the
 ability
 to
 scale
 a
 few
 decades
 ago
 to
 be
 a
 computer
 user
 meant
 to
 be
 a
 programmer
 every
 programmer
 knew
 the
 instruction
 set
 architecture
 will
 and
 because
 hardware
 resources
 were
 scarce
 scars
 had
 to
 optimize
 in
 assembly
 language
 with
 the
 advent
 of
 high
 level
 programming
 languages
 such
 as
 cc
 java
 and
 python
 why
 do
 students
 still
 have
 to
 learn
 computer
 organization
 caching
 and
 assembly
 language
 when
 you
 know
 that
 the
 compiler
 is
 doing
 for
 you
 and
 makes
 you
 a
 better
 programmer
 because
 you
 understand
 what
 is
 going
 on
 behind
 the
 scenes
 similarly
 you
 become
 better
 at
 debugging
 unique
 how
 many
 legal
 questions
 are
 you
 working
 on
 these
 days
 can
 you
 make
 sure
 you
 do
 3
 questions
 a
 day
 so
 that
 you
 can
 find
 a
 job
 for
 the
 summer
 right
 i
 should
 be
 doing
 so
 since
 i
 am
 still
 jobless
 for
 summer
 i
 will
 try
 to
 do
 3
 little
 questions
 for
 sure
 so
 that
 i
 lend
 anywhere
 that
 wants
 to
 hire
 me
 anyway
 fast
 forward
 to
 today
 when
 you
 are
 developing
 applications
 on
 the
 cloud
 there
 does
 not
 yet
 exist
 a
 compiler
 that
 allocates
 massive
 virtualized
 resources
 automatically
 to
 solve
 your
 specific
 problem
 it
 is
 up
 to
 you
 the
 cloud
 programmer
 to
 do
 the
 management
 and
 to
 make
 your
 applications
 cost
 efficient
 at
 scale
 analogous
 to
 understanding
 the
 components
 within
 a
 single
 computer
 knowing
 the
 underlying
 components
 of
 a
 data
 center
 will
 improve
 your
 abilities
 to
 program
 and
 debug
 your
 cloud
 based
 applications
 most
 of
 you
 will
 never
 go
 on
 to
 design
 and
 build
 your
 own
 large
 scale
 data
 center
 but
 understanding
 what
 goes
 into
 implementing
 the
 underlying
 infrastructure
 will
 help
 you
 appreciate
 all
 things
 that
 cloud
 providers
 are
 doing
 for
 you
 the
 term
 data
 center
 became
 popular
 in
 1990s
 referring
 to
 large
 rooms
 dedicated
 to
 housing
 computing
 and
 the
 networking
 equipment
 though
 computer
 rooms
 themselves
 date
 back
 much
 further
 early
 computers
 were
 massive
 the
 size
 of
 many
 refrigerators
 they
 also
 generate
 a
 lot
 of
 heat
 energy
 required
 clean
 air
 refrigeration
 to
 increase
 reliability
 for
 this
 reason
 already
 computer
 could
 not
 be
 placed
 into
 a
 regular
 office
 so
 customs
 rooms
 were
 built
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 same
 ideas
 go
 into
 server
 rooms
 today
 the
 only
 difference
 is
 that
 instead
 of
 housing
 one
 computer
 they
 hold
 from
 dozens
 to
 hundreds
 to
 even
 10s
 of
 thousands
 of
 servers
 in
 a
 single
 hostility
 so
 modularity
 is
 important
 for
 data
 centers
 because
 it
 allows
 an
 organization
 to
 expand
 as
 needed
 one
 of
 the
 enablers
 of
 a
 modular
 data
 center
 has
 been
 standardized
 racks
 onto
 which
 it
 equipment
 is
 mounted
 historically
 server
 racks
 have
 evolved
 from
 early
 relay
 rats
 rats
 found
 in
 railroad
 signals
 it
 is
 unclear
 why
 the
 railroad
 companies
 chose
 the
 original
 19
 inch
 post
 to
 post
 width
 but
 the
 same
 form
 factor
 made
 its
 way
 into
 early
 telecommunications
 and
 then
 audio
 visual
 equipments
 at
 radio
 and
 television
 stations
 some
 of
 the
 advantages
 of
 labrax
 design
 over
 common
 products
 so
 there
 is
 include
 fire
 safety
 where
 rack
 posts
 and
 other
 footings
 were
 cast
 out
 of
 our
 and
 later
 still
 this
 became
 superior
 to
 earlier
 wooden
 enclosures
 that
 could
 possibly
 ignite
 and
 damage
 all
 equipment
 inside
 nexus
 feel
 assembly
 where
 racks
 could
 be
 assembled
 using
 common
 hand
 tools
 and
 low
 skilled
 workers
 thirdly
 regularly
 spaced
 holes
 which
 is
 to
 support
 a
 wide
 variety
 of
 equipment
 and
 lastly
 vertical
 mounting
 surface
 allowing
 easier
 installation
 maintenance
 and
 wiring
 many
 of
 today
 is
 standard
 19
 inch
 equipment
 racks
 have
 evolved
 from
 labrax
 sign
 can
 dujour
 prepare
 a
 brief
 diagram
 of
 labour
 is
 design
 nothing
 fancy
 just
 like
 a
 simple
 drawing
 thing
 yeah
 sure
 i
 can
 do
 that
 over
 the
 past
 few
 decades
 data
 centers
 have
 growing
 both
 in
 size
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 number
 of
 racks
 and
 cabinets
 and
 intensity
 greater
 density
 has
 become
 possible
 because
 of
 advances
 in
 cpus
 integrated
 circuit
 and
 a
 printed
 circuit
 board
 design
 this
 leads
 to
 faster
 and
 more
 powerful
 computers
 within
 the
 same
 area
 the
 minimum
 size
 of
 of
 an
 element
 on
 an
 integrated
 circuit
 or
 the
 feature
 size
 has
 become
 smaller
 by
 orders
 of
 magnitude
 over
 the
 last
 four
 decades
 individual
 transistors
 has
 reduced
 in
 size
 from
 about
 10
 microns
 in
 1971
 to
 about
 0022
 microns
 in
 2013
 party
 dividual
 transistors
 get
 smaller
 more
 can
 speed
 on
 the
 silicon
 so
 each
 transistor
 consumes
 less
 power
 within
 the
 same
 thermal
 constraints
 cpu
 is
 have
 gone
 from
 single
 core
 to
 16
 cores
 with
 transistor
 counts
 going
 from
 millions
 to
 billions
 additionally
 accelerators
 and
 co
 processors
 have
 emerged
 that
 provide
 hundreds
 of
 additional
 floating
 points
 units
 each
 with
 increasing
 floating
 point
 operation
 per
 second
 per
 watt
 also
 recent
 storage
 arrays
 have
 gone
 from
 supporting
 3
 or
 4
 mechanical
 hard
 drives
 per
 rack
 units
 to
 15
 to
 21
 drives
 per
 rack
 unit
 hence
 although
 the
 power
 efficiency
 of
 individual
 components
 has
 improved
 over
 the
 years
 computers
 themselves
 have
 become
 more
 dense
 packing
 in
 more
 processing
 cores
 memory
 and
 storage
 per
 square
 foot
 this
 density
 caused
 the
 overall
 power
 consumption
 per
 rack
 to
 rise
 dramatically
 over
 the
 last
 few
 years
 this
 trend
 means
 that
 both
 power
 and
 cooling
 requirements
 also
 increase
 per
 data
 center
 a
 large
 data
 center
 now
 consumes
 several
 medical
 words
 of
 power
 which
 is
 roughly
 the
 same
 power
 requirements
 of
 a
 small
 town
 well
 that
 is
 amazing
 so
 turning
 data
 centers
 are
 important
 in
 terms
 of
 cloud
 computing
 discussion
 about
 cloud
 computing
 gives
 me
 a
 headache
 i
 am
 already
 experiencing
 you
 know
 cloud
 computing
 stuff
 in
 my
 life
 yeah
 let
 us
 call
 it
 a
 day
 i
 might
 faint
 soon
 have
 an
 amazing
 weekend
 everyone
 else
 see
 you
 next
 week
 bye
