60
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:50.240
Yooni Choi: But another Mr. Mardo's lawyers. Jim Griffin told jurors and Thursday that the notion that Mr. Mardo would try to evade the crut any of his finances by placing himself in the middle of a murder investigation. Strain, credulity.

67
00:09:47.270 --> 00:10:06.180
Yooni Choi: That confrontation, Mr. Waters said, was one of the 2 increase in to Mr. Mardo's finances that led him to fear. The walls were closing in; the other was an effort by another large mark.

Jiahe Feng: that so that he, surviving some buster, could collect on his insurance policy.

74
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:19.540

Jiahe Feng: a small data center in my fitting one specialized one, while a large installation might be a dedicated warehouse. Sized facility.

110
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:17.810
Yooni Choi: Data Center design requirements depend on its size and use. Cloud Centric data centers could come in 2 varieties. An infrastructure as a service class provider offers a variety of machine types, and the customers pick and choose to build their own applications

111
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:26.900
Yooni Choi: software as a service and a platform as a service. Providers typically use large scale homogeneous compute notes with custom applications that are presented to end users directly.

112
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:40.200
Yooni Choi: Other types of data centers include enterprise, traditional it which houses computers to support, functions for day to day business operations and high performance computing data centers which has large clusters of 4 scientific applications.

113
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:56.090
DAZHI PENG: In the last 5 years specifically, attention has been paid for the efficiency of the centers dramatically decreasing the operational uses causes and a carbon fu. This increasing efficiency has led to a bus evolution on data Center design, and the trends are likely to continue

114
00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:05.020
DAZHI PENG: effectively. Use of cloud resources and develop a large seal. Dynamic applications for the cloud require understanding of the physical resources that make up the cloud.

115
00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:21.760
DAZHI PENG: In this unit we start with trends in data centers, present components at a makeup of data centers and discuss data. That is, that considerations and a requirement. If you think of the cloud as a massive computer, you can still break it down into its constituent parts.

116
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.250
Jiahe Feng: processors, memory and switch.

117
00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:41.800
Jiahe Feng: When you are programming for the cloud, you're writing programs to solve a problem or provide a service. But with the ability to scale a few decades ago to be a computer user meant to be a programmer every program, and you the instruction set architecture well, and because hardware resources were scared

118
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:56.650
Jiahe Feng: scars, how to optimize your Assembly language with the advent of high level programming languages, such as C and C plus Java and python. Why do students still have to learn computer organization, caching and assembling language?

119
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:04.730
Jiahe Feng: When you know that the compiler is doing for you. It makes you a better programmer, because you understand what is going on behind the scenes.

120
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.890
Jiahe Feng: Similarly, you become better at debugging.

121
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:16.580
Jiahe Feng: unique. How many legal legal questions are you working on these days? Can you make sure you do 3 questions a day so that you can find a job for the summer

122
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:25.430
Yooni Choi: right I should be doing so, since I'm still jobless for summer. I'll try to do 3. Let go questions for sure, so that I lend anywhere that wants to hire me

123
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:42.770
Yooni Choi: anyway. Fast forward to today, when you are developing applications on the cloud, there does not yet exist a compiler that allocates massive, virtualized resources automatically to solve your specific problem. It is up to you, the cloud programmer, to do the management and to make your applications cost efficient at scale

124
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:52.450
Yooni Choi: analogous to understanding the components within a single computer, Knowing the underlying components of a data center will improve your abilities to program and debug your cloud based applications.

125
00:18:52.480 --> 00:19:03.160
Most of you will never go on to design and build your own large scale data center. But understanding what goes into implementing the underlying infrastructure will help you appreciate all things that cloud providers are doing for you.

126
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:14.640
DAZHI PENG: The term data center became popular in 1990, referring to large rooms dedicated to forcing, computing and the networking equipment. Though computer rooms themselves, they back much further.

127
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:23.820
DAZHI PENG: 30 computers will match it. Besides the manufacturer. They also generate a lot of heat, and it required a clean air refutation to increase reliability.

128
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:42.750
DAZHI PENG: For this reason early computers could not be placed into a regular office. So customs rooms were used. A lot of these same ideas go into several rooms today. The only difference is that instead of housing one computer, they hold from dozens to 100 to even tenth of size of server. In a single facility.

129
00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:58.280
Jiahe Feng: Modularity is important for data centers, because it allows an organization to expand as needed. One of the enablers of a modular data center as being standardized racks onto which it equipment is mounted.

130
00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:05.850
Jiahe Feng: Historically, silver racks have evolved from early relay rats, racks, phone and railroad signals.

131
00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:21.850
Jiahe Feng: It is unclear. Why the real road companies chose the original 19 inch host to post with. But the same form form factor made its way into early telecommunications and then audio visual equipment and radio and television stations.

132
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.460
Yooni Choi: some of the advantages of labyrinth's design over a common.

133
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:38.040
Yooni Choi: So there's include a fire safety where rack, posts, and other footings were cast out of our, and later still this became superior to earlier. What an enclosures that could possibly ignite and damage all equipment inside

134
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:53.590
Yooni Choi: Nexus Fuel assembly, where racks could be assembled, using common hand tools and low skill workers. Thirdly, regularly space holes, which is to support a wide variety of equipment; and lastly, vertical mounting surface allow an easier installation, maintenance and wiring

135
00:20:53.590 --> 00:21:03.840
Yooni Choi: many of today's standard 19 inch equipment wax have evolved from lyrics design. Can that you prepare a brief diagram of lyrics design? Nothing. Fancy just like a simple drawing thing.

136
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:12.630
DAZHI PENG: Yeah, sure I could do that. Over the past 2 decades the the centers have growing both in size in terms of the number of wrecked, and the

137
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:19.980
DAZHI PENG: greater density has become possible because of advancing. If you use in the root circuit and a printed circuit board design.

138
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.190
DAZHI PENG: this leads to faster and more powerful computers within the same area.

139
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:32.690
DAZHI PENG: The menu sites of of an element on a integrated start to it called the feature side had to become all the the magnitude over the last 4 decades.

140
00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:42.160
DAZHI PENG: Individual transistors has reduced in size from about 10 microns in 1,971 to about 0 point 0 3 2 micro in 2,014.

141
00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:47.420
DAZHI PENG: But the video transistors get smaller. More can be done with teams silicon.

142
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:59.880
Jiahe Feng: So each register consumes the last power within the same thermal constraints. Cpus have gone from single core to 16 course, with transistor counts going from millions to billions.

143
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:11.700
Jiahe Feng: Additionally, accelerators and co processors have emerged that provide hundreds of additional floating points units, each with increasing floating point. Operation per second per walk.

144
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:20.950
Jiahe Feng: Also, recent storage arrays have gone from supporting 3 or 4 mechanical hard drives per at units to 15 to 21 drives per rack unit.

145
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:32.650
Yooni Choi: And so, though the power efficiency of individual components has improved over the years computers themselves have become more dense packing in more processing course, memory and storage per square foot.

146
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:48.910
Yooni Choi: This density caused the overall power consumption for rack to rise dramatically over the last few years. This trend means that both power and cooling requirements also increase for data center. A large data center now consumes several megawatts of power which is roughly the same power requirements of a small town.

147
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:54.000
DAZHI PENG: Well, that's amazing. So during data send it are important in terms of cloud. Computing

148
00:22:55.010 --> 00:23:01.040
Jiahe Feng: discussion about calm computing gives me a headache I'm already experiencing, you know, Cloud computing stuff in my life.

149
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:07.310
Yooni Choi: Yeah, let's call it a day on my face soon Have an amazing weekend, Everyone else you next week, Bye.
