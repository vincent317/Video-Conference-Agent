00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.400
Okay. Let's start today's meeting since it seems like everyone's here.

1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.470
How was your week?

2
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.300
Mine was super busy with three midterms this week,

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.800
but I'm excited for the spring break.

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.370
You have any plans.

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.190
I don't have any plans right now, but I would just say anything here and blah, blah,

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.750
blah.

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.590
You know, it's your turn dot

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.290
I'm already at Atlanta. I can't wait to leave Pittsburgh.

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.440
Yeah. Sounds fun.

10
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.070
Mine was super busy too with all those cloud work which is still ongoing.

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.180
I guess I'll be also be working on the poolside while I'm at Cancun.

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.920
Anyway, let's start off with our first agenda item.

13
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.020
Duke and Duchess of suspects asked to vacate. You came home Frogmore cottage.

14
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.500
Okay. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex has been asked to vacate Broadmoor College.

15
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.890
The cables official UK residents, their spokesman Tuesday and Wednesday.

16
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.790
The spokesman said we can confirm the Duke and Duchess of

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.140
Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore cottage

18
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.830
that is said the statement followed, reporting British newspaper,

19
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.890
The Sun that claimed the pier was being evicted

20
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.010
from the property which is owned by the crown estate

21
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.240
and that it had since been offered to Prince Andrew.

22
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.380
One of king charts three's brother

23
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.390
Birmingham Palace said Wednesday

24
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.110
it would be offering no comment.

25
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.130
A royal source told CNN that any such discussions would be a private family matter.

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.200
Prince Harry and Meghan now reside in the

27
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.680
United States but had retained the early 19th

28
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.340
century property as a UK base gifted to

29
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.750
the success by the late Queen Elizabeth third,

30
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.520
the second, the cottages nestled in a quarter of the Windsors estate west of London.

31
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.280
They refurbished the property and moved in shortly before the

32
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.350
arrival of their son Archie in May 9 2019.

33
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.140
However,

34
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.510
the renovation sparked controversy after the couple

35
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.150
stepped back from public life and it

36
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.660
emerged about $3 million of British taxpayers

37
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.340
money had been used under college refurbishments.

38
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.400
They have since paid back the public

39
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.960
money following their relocation to California.

40
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.330
Seems like loyal life, something that I definitely wanted to try out.

41
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.300
Yeah, don't even mention someone else paying my rent would be amazing

42
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.210
works including the removal of chimney re finishing the roof, new staircases,

43
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.880
fireplaces,

44
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.210
installations and the new floating wooden

45
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.330
floor were detailed in planning application.

46
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.220
Documents to the local council.

47
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.430
The course of all buildings,

48
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.950
pictures and the furnishings were paid for privately by the Duke and Duchess.

49
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.880
I guess we will need to finalize the accounting regarding

50
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.920
how much was paid to the Duke and Duchess.

51
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.280
Can you work on that by the next meeting?

52
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.190
Yes,

53
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.230
certainly the success stay at the property when they returned to the U K last year,

54
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.030
including when they attended the Queen's platinum jubilee

55
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.280
celebrations during the summit.

56
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.560
Prince Andrew recently resigned nearby at the royal lodge at on the Windsor estate.

57
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.500
The Duke of York also stepped back from Royal duties in

58
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.990
2019 after a disastrous interview about his friendship with disgraced financial,

59
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.650
Jeffrey Epstein involved the family in an unprecedented crisis.

60
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.990
According to the Sun,

61
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.960
the couple were reportedly asked to leave the

62
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.240
property days after the release of Harry's memoir,

63
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.290
Speer in January, the 38 year old Royal held almost nothing back as his dismantle.

64
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.870
The public's perception of him being the fun loving,

65
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.260
carefree party prince and delved into the

66
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.230
devastating impact of his mother's death.

67
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.950
His experimentation with drugs as a method of coping

68
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.440
with grief and his struggles at finding love.

69
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.840
Buckingham Palace repeatedly declined to comment on the memoir,

70
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.830
The autobiography, follow the six part Netflix documentary.

71
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.450
The couple released last year and an

72
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.780
explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021.

73
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.570
They alleged there were concerns in the royal family about our kids skin colors,

74
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.340
details,

75
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.500
feelings of being trapped and said magnet has

76
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.200
suicidal source to increase her first pregnancy.

77
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.610
Something interesting. Can you all watch the show by

78
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.530
and share your source on it?

79
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.350
Yeah, I was gonna watch it anyway soon.

80
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.700
I just haven't had a chance to find my free time.

81
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.230
Okay. Lets now move on to our next item, Alex Myrtle guilty. Alex murder.

82
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.240
All the first generation lawyer whose family long their influence in the small town

83
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.590
courtrooms across parts of South Carolina was

84
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.800
convicted on Thursday of murdering his weapons.

85
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.500
Sealing the dramatic example of a man

86
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.150
who has substantial wealth and powerful connections,

87
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.350
but who lived a secret life in which he is the millions of dollars

88
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.360
from clients and colleagues and lie too many of those closest to him.

89
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.540
The guilty verdict following a nearly six week long trial,

90
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.530
more than 20 hour month after the June

91
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.680
2021 fatal shooting of Mr Murdock's wife Maggie 52

92
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.830
their son, Paul 22 on the family royal estate.

93
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.820
The grizzly

94
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.220
crime had reverberated across the state.

95
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.190
In part because of the story storied history of the Myrtle family

96
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.700
which controlled the regional prosecutor's office

97
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.890
in South Carolina low country region

98
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.980
for more than eight years and ran an influential law firm for even longer.

99
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.020
Alan Wilson said today's verdict proved that no one, no one,

100
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.380
no matter who you are in society is above the law.

101
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.630
The state Attorney General at a news conference

102
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.790
after the verdict in finding Mr Martinez guilty.

103
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.080
Jurors rejected his claim that he had left the dog

104
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.200
channels where the crimes occurred several minutes before the shootings.

105
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.240
An assertion Mr Martel made from the witness stand only

106
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.430
as a fallback after prosecutors played a video contracting,

107
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.150
his longstanding claim that he had not been there at all.

108
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.400
The crucial minute long video recorded at the Canada

109
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.210
happened to capture Mr Myrtle's voice in the background.

110
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.040
It was taken by Paul Model in one of his last living moments

111
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.190
and act that inadvertently helped to secure the conviction of his brother.

112
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.220
Prosecutors contended that Mr Murdoch had killed his son with a shocking

113
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.520
then gunned down his wife with a rifle when she ran over to see what had happened.

114
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.750
Prosecutors said Mr Murdock quickly set about creating alibi

115
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.270
texting and calling his slim wife and visiting

116
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.620
his ailing mothers a short drive away.

117
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.630
Mr Marto stood silently in the courtroom as the verdicts were read, his older son,

118
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.690
Buster Marto who had testified about how distraught his father had been after

119
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.970
the killings sat in the courtroom with the hand over his mouth.

120
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.090
The jury also found Mr Marto guilty of the two counts of

121
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.010
possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.

122
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.130
Judge Clifton Newman said he would sentence Mr Martin on Friday morning,

123
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.820
the minimum sentence for murder, 30 years in prison.

124
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.130
And prosecutors have said they will seek a sentence

125
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.500
of life in prison without the possibility of peril

126
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.610
Dick Harper.

127
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.450
Till in one of Mr Martin's lawyers said he planned to appeal the verdict.

128
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.570
Would it be possible for us to have summary of

129
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.720
his charges and verdicts be ready in two weeks?

130
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.810
I think two weeks is too much. Let's have them ready within a week.

131
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.490
The trial was a reckoning of miss merteuil

132
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.760
legal consequences for stealing in line since humility to from the witness stand.

133
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.730
And as he led a life of privilege and wealth, in addition to the stolen money,

134
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.060
he breaking millions of dollars to genuine income in

135
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.660
some years as a lawyer from his family's firm,

136
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.260
Mr Myrtle once dreamed of following in the footsteps of his father,

137
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.100
grandfather and great grandfather and becoming the region's top prosecutor,

138
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.560
but instead,

139
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.620
it's erroneous as a volunteer prosecutor working on

140
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.630
a handful of cases over two decades.

141
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.050
Nonetheless,

142
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.760
he kept a prosecutor patch on the dashboard of his card and blue flashing light

143
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.850
assigned. Prosecutors said that he viewed himself as above the law.

144
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:55.420
Mr Murdock was disbarred last summer after being charged with multiple

145
00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.350
financial crimes including theft in total of about 8.8 million.

146
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.630
Mr Murdoch claimed that he had taken the money to pay for opioid

147
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.370
addiction that was something costing him tens of thousands of dollars a week.

148
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:09.970
A prosecutor

149
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.700
Zhang Meters gave a brief closing argument in rebuttal on Thursday,

150
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.620
urging jurors not to believe the claims of innocence

151
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.920
that Mr Merrill had made from the witness stand.

152
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:25.670
The jury of seven men and five women began liberating just before four PM

153
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.460
mode of having a question from the beginning of the case.

154
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.730
Prosecutors argued that Mr Marto committed the killings and in the field effort

155
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.770
to gain sympathy and to keep his longtime embezzlement from being exposed.

156
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.309
But another Mr Martos lawyers,

157
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.600
Jim Griffin told jurors on Thursday that the notion that Mr Martin would try to evade

158
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.350
scrutiny of his finances by placing himself in

159
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.160
the middle of a murder investigation strained credulity.

160
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.150
Mr Griffin asked saying, why, why,

161
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.310
why would Alex Myrtle on June 7th execute his sample

162
00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.210
and his wife Maggie who he adored in love,

163
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.430
noting the number of people who know the Myrtle

164
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.790
family and testified about their loving relationship creating water.

165
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.190
The lead prosecutor noted Mr Myrtle admitted on the witness stated that he

166
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.680
had put many lives over the years to cover up his financial misdealings,

167
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.280
an addiction to painkillers.

168
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.130
Mr Waters urged the jurors to avoid becoming the next one to believe in his life.

169
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.500
He said, don't let him fool you too.

170
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:31.050
Mr Waters told jurors that a perfect storm had been approaching Mr Madoff

171
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.100
and by extension, his wife and son on the day of the murders.

172
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.790
Earlier that day,

173
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.110
Mr Murdoch had been confronted by his law firm's financial chief who accused him of

174
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.190
pocketing six figure check that he was supposed to pass along to the law firm.

175
00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.460
That confrontation.

176
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.770
Mr Waters said was one of the two increase into Mr Martos

177
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.800
finances that led him to fear the walls were closing in.

178
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.490
The other was an effort by another large mark

179
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.880
intensely who had sued Mr Martin over his son's involvement

180
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.710
in a drunken boat crash in 2019 that resulted in the death of a 19 year old woman.

181
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.960
The authorities that the boat was driven by Paul Martin

182
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.920
and Mr Tinsley had been asking a lawyer to force Mr Martel to disclose

183
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.380
detailed financial records so that he could go after Mr Martin personal assets.

184
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.490
Initially,

185
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:23.210
prosecutors that Mr Models in work for several months after the murders,

186
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.880
the increase into his finances were holding.

187
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.750
But then in September 2021 an employee at his law firm

188
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.170
office,

189
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.790
leading to the firm's discovery that he had a title of millions of dollars,

190
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.300
they forced him to run

191
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.340
the next day.

192
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.040
In a bizarre series of events,

193
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.480
Mr Murdock reported that he had been shot in the head on the side of a rural roll.

194
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.730
It turned out as Mr Murdoch admitted from a detox facility days later that

195
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.700
he had actually asked a distance cousin Curtis Eddie Smith to kill him.

196
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.330
Mr Murdoch

197
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.620
said he had wanted to frame his death as a murderer

198
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.680
that so that he's surviving. Some Buster could collect on his insurance policy.

199
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.700
Much of the trial focused on Mr Murdock's lives,

200
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.710
including the one that he repeated to police in three interviews after the murders

201
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.420
in which he claimed to have not been at the family dog kennels.

202
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.710
Mr Morrow made the risky decision to take the witness stand

203
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.790
in his own defense last week and said in tearful testimony that

204
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.950
he lied to the police because he feared he would become

205
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.750
a suspect if he acknowledged being at the Kennels that night.

206
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.270
He had said he had been there for a few minutes,

207
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.170
but then had left and driven to check on

208
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.940
his ailing mother who lived about 15 minutes away.

209
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.610
He said he returned about an hour later to find his family. Dad,

210
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.960
Mr Griffin addressed Miss Myrtle's initial statements to

211
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.730
the police directly on Thursday saying that the video

212
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.860
from the cameras turned out to be the backbone of a case that like any other evidence.

213
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.180
But as a longtime drug addict,

214
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.400
Mr Myrtle has become accustomed to telling life is that

215
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.840
Mr Griffin said frankly,

216
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.900
he probably wouldn't be sitting over here if he hadn't lied,

217
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:12.570
pointing to his client was set at the defense table in a bronze blazer and white shirt

218
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.860
intensely watching the proceedings.

219
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.540
Mr Griffin added

220
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.540
he lied because that's what addicts do, addicts lie.

221
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.140
He lied because he had a closet full of skeletons

222
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.610
throughout the trial.

223
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.460
Mr Murdock lawyers argued that the police were sloppy in their investigation and

224
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.320
had focused almost exclusively on Mister Murdoch

225
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.380
instead of looking for other suspects.

226
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.430
Mr Griffin characterized the police investigation as being driven

227
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.620
by the concept that useless unless we find someone,

228
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.550
somebody else.

229
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.030
It's gonna be Alice

230
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.100
in his testimony.

231
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.780
Mr Morrow said he believed the killings were probably carried

232
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.680
out by someone seeking revenge over the boat crash.

233
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.210
Mr Griffin had ticked through problems in the investigation in his

234
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.540
closing arguments including that the lead agent David Owen of the

235
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.860
South Carolina Law Enforcement division gave false testimony about guns found

236
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.870
on the property to the grand jurors who convicted Mr Moto.

237
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.320
He also noted that the police had for months wrongly believed that

238
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.530
blood spatter had been found on Mr Martinez shared when in fact,

239
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.910
more rigorous tests taken later showed no blood.

240
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.130
He also criticized the prosecution for his contention,

241
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.800
that means Myrtle inconsistent,

242
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.750
convinced about the timeline of his movements suggested that he was the killer.

243
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.870
Mr Griffin said, can you imagine what he's done? Talking bacterias?

244
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:34.910
As he described Myrtle returning home to find his wife and son que he added that and

245
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.050
his evidence of guilt that he doesn't remember

246
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.540
what the sequence he was in that moment.

247
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.460
Is there evidence of guilt or is there evidence of Trump?

248
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.190
But Mr Waters Hammer Mr Murdock on his

249
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.700
previous deceptions asking Mr Metal repeatedly when he was

250
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.050
understand if he had looked at his clients in the eye when he stole their money.

251
00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.390
And since suggesting that he had, he was also lying to the jury.

252
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.190
He's fooled them all.

253
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.610
Mr Water said of the victims of Mr Murdock's dissects.

254
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.690
He fooled Maggie and thought to and they paid for it with their lives.

255
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.960
Isn't it tragic that a man from such a well established family put blood on his hand,

256
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.940
right?

257
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.420
Who would have ever imagined people around him would have been hard to believe?

258
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.570
Will there be any movies or documentaries, documentaries being made of the story.

259
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.350
Oh, I was certainly watching if there's going to be won, by the way,

260
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.230
since we're talking about murder and blood and all those kind of stuff,

261
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.870
I can't wait for this quick game to, to be released.

262
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.630
Yeah,

263
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.640
it's going to be released later this year.

264
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.360
Right. Season one was so fun. I finished in the day

265
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.640
binge watching all the best. Not gonna lie.

266
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.100
Sad that we don't get those privileges anymore because all

267
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.440
of the work that's piled up in front of us.

268
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:54.170
Moving on to our last general item about data centers.

269
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.490
They doesn't include a room or building I T equipment and

270
00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.100
facilities to securely cause power and the code of equipment.

271
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.740
Over the years, data centers have evolved from our location,

272
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.030
concentrated I T equipment to modular agile and highly virtualized

273
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.110
compute standards with growing use of web based services,

274
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.000
explosion of mobile devices and ever increasing rates of

275
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.640
generation.

276
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.610
One of the main contributors of the growth

277
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.880
has been the advance of the cloud computing paradigm

278
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.790
in which cost effectiveness is directly

279
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.320
linked to economies of scale and efficiencies

280
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.960
gained with new data center design,

281
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.290
all layer of cloud software and services run on top of physical resources,

282
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.650
largely service

283
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.210
storage and networking equipment

284
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.630
and all of these require power.

285
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.550
This equipment also generates heat and so requires Cooley,

286
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.610
a small data center might fit in one specialized room while

287
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:02.340
a large installation might be a dedicated warehouse sized facility.

288
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.910
Data center design requirements depend on its size and use cloud

289
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.490
centric data centers could come in two varieties and infrastructure.

290
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:15.390
As a service cloud provider offers a variety of machine types and the customers

291
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:19.960
pick and choose to build their own applications software as a service and platform.

292
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.610
As a service providers typically use large scale homogeneous computer notes

293
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.880
with custom applications that are presented to end users directly.

294
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.220
Other types of data centers include enterprise traditional I

295
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.170
T which houses computers to support functions for day

296
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.280
to day business operations and high performance computing data

297
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.040
centers which house large clusters of four scientific applications

298
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.760
in the last five years.

299
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.280
Specifically,

300
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.920
attention has been paid for the visions of data centers

301
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.160
dramatically decreasing the operational usage causes and carbon footprint.

302
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.130
This increasing efficiency has led to a fast evolution on data

303
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:57.250
center design and these trends are likely to continue effective use of

304
00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:01.560
cloud resources and development of large scale dynamic applications for the cloud

305
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.900
require understanding of the physical resources that make up the cloud.

306
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:06.329
In this unit,

307
00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:10.190
we started with transient data centers present components and make up

308
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.740
data centers and discuss data center design considerations and requirements.

309
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.700
If you think of the cloud as a massive computer,

310
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.819
you can still break it down into its constituent parts, processors,

311
00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.970
memory and switch when you're programming for the cloud,

312
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.510
your writing programs that solve a problem or provide a service.

313
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.170
But with the ability to scale

314
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.540
a few decades ago to be a computer user meant to be a programmer.

315
00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.850
Every programmer knew the instruction set architecture will.

316
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.660
And because hardware resources were scared,

317
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.280
scars had to optimize in assembly language.

318
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.780
With the advent of high level programming languages such as C and C plus plus,

319
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:54.540
Java and Python, why do students still have to learn computer organization,

320
00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:58.590
cashing and assembly language when you know that the compiler

321
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.440
is doing for you and makes you a better programmer?

322
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.760
Because you understand what is going on behind the scenes.

323
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.780
Similarly, you become better at debugging

324
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.160
unique. How many legal questions are you working on these days?

325
00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:16.480
Can you make sure you do three questions a day so that you can find a job for the summer?

326
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.790
Right?

327
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.470
I should be doing so since I'm still jobless for summer,

328
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.760
I'll try to do three little questions for sure.

329
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.410
So that I learned anywhere that wants to hire me anyway, fast forward to today.

330
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.880
When you are developing applications on the cloud,

331
00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.530
there does not yet exist a compiler that allocates

332
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:36.600
massive virtualized resources automatically to solve your specific problem.

333
00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.140
It is up to you the cloud programmer to do the

334
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.700
management and to make your applications cost efficient at scale.

335
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.160
Analogous to understanding the components within a single computer,

336
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.950
knowing the underlying components of a data center will improve

337
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.330
your abilities to program and debug your cloud based applications.

338
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.340
Most of you will never go on to design and build your own large scale data center.

339
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.870
But understanding what goes into

340
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.020
implementing the underlying infrastructure will help

341
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.060
you appreciate all things that cloud providers are doing for you.

342
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.510
The term data center became popular in 1990s referring to

343
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.390
large rooms dedicated to housing computing and the networking equipment.

344
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.610
Though computer rooms themselves date back much further,

345
00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.320
early computers were massive, the size of many refrigerators.

346
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.240
They also generate a lot of heat and

347
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.840
required a clean air refrigeration to increase reliability.

348
00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.140
For this reason, early computer could not be placed into a regular office.

349
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.450
So customs rooms were built.

350
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.720
A lot of these same ideas go into server room debate.

351
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.560
The only difference is that instead of housing one computer,

352
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.260
they hold from dozens to hundreds to even tens

353
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.930
of thousands of servers in a single facility.

354
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.840
Modularity is important for data centers because it

355
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.670
allows an organization to expand as needed.

356
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.100
One of the enablers of a modular data center has

357
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.150
been standardized racks onto which I T equipment is mounted.

358
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:03.240
Historically, server racks have evolved from early relate rats,

359
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.640
racks found and railroad signaling.

360
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:12.560
It is unclear why the railroad companies chose the original 19" post to post with.

361
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.770
But the same form form factor made its way into early

362
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.860
telecommunications and then audio visual equipment

363
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.690
at radio and television stations.

364
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.300
Some of the advantages of lab rex design over a common protest

365
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.570
services include fire safety where rack posts and other

366
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.860
fittings were cast out of iron and later steel.

367
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.530
This became superior to earlier wooden enclosures that

368
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.940
could possibly ignite and damage all equipment inside

369
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.700
Nexus Feel assembly where racks could be assembled

370
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.350
using common hand tools and low skill workers.

371
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.170
Thirdly regularly spaced holes which is to support a wide variety of

372
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.090
equipment and lastly vertical mounting surface

373
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.420
allowing easier installation maintenance and wiring.

374
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.000
Many of today's standard 19 inch equipment

375
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.600
racks have evolved from Mavericks design can

376
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.090
prepare a brief diagram of lab design. Nothing fancy.

377
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.540
Just like a simple drawing thing. Yes, sure, I could do that.

378
00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.500
Over the past few decades, citizens

379
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.840
have grown both in size in terms of

380
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.340
the number of racks and cabinets and intensity greater

381
00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.750
density has become possible because of advances in CPU

382
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.870
integrated circuit and a printed circuit board design.

383
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.350
This leads to faster and more powerful computers within the same area.

384
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.080
The minimum size of an element on an integrated circuit called

385
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.080
the feature size has become smaller by orders of magnitude.

386
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.690
Over the last four decades,

387
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.220
individual transistors has reduced insights from about 10 microns

388
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:42.100
in 1971 to about 0.22 microns in 2013.

389
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:46.090
But individual transistors get smaller more can fit out the

390
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.240
silicon.

391
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:53.640
So each transistor consumes less power within the same thermal constraints.

392
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.560
CPUS have gone from single quality 16 course

393
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.720
with transistor counts going from millions to billions.

394
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.090
Additionally,

395
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.960
accelerators and co processors have emerged that provide hundreds of additional

396
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.570
floating point units each with increasing floating point operations per second

397
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:11.460
per once.

398
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.510
Also,

399
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.240
recent storage rates have gone from supporting three

400
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.810
or four mechanical hard drives per ac units

401
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.080
15-21 drives per

402
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:20.790
unit.

403
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.290
And although the power efficiency of individual

404
00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.470
components has improved over the years,

405
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.510
computers themselves have become more dense packing in more processing course,

406
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.750
memory and storage per square foot.

407
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.490
This density caused the overall power consumption per rack

408
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.960
to rise dramatically over the last few years.

409
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.310
This trend means that both power and cooling requirements also increased.

410
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.850
For data center, a large data center now consumes several medical watts of power,

411
00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.810
which is roughly the same power requirements of a small town.

412
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.650
Well,

413
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.920
that's amazing filtering data centers are important in terms of cloud computing

414
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.820
discussion about cloud computing gives me a headache.

415
00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.900
I'm already experiencing, you know, cloud computing stuff in my life.

416
00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.360
Yeah, let's call it a day on my faint soon. Have an amazing weekend. Everyone else.

417
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.240
See you next week. Bye.
