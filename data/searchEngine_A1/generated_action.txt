Jeffrey will start working on implementing the BM25 algorithm in Python.
Dazhi will implement the BM25 algorithm in Java.
Yooni will translate the Python code of the BM25 algorithm to Java.
Yooni and Jeffrey will read up more on the Indri probabilistic model and try to implement it in Python.
Dazhi will implement the Indri model in Java on his own.
Dazhi and Yooni will read up on how to implement reranking for search engines.
Jeffrey will study what machine learning model to use for reranking.
They will discuss and decide on a dataset after implementing the BM25 algorithm in Python.
They will discuss and decide which library to use after reading more about the Indri model.
They will consider using MapReduce or Spark for the implementation of the Indri model.
They aim to complete the implementation of the BM25 algorithm in Python within the next week.
They aim to have a basic implementation of the Indri model in Python within two weeks.
They aim to have a better understanding of the available options for reranking within the next week.
