2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.970
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, some are exciting. Some are depressing. The exciting news is that open AI release its latest multi-model Gd. 4 model

3
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:35.100
Jeffrey Feng: Well, less capable than humans in many real world scenarios, except it's human level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks. For example, it passes a simulated bar exam with a score around the top. 10% of test takers in contrast, Gp 3.5 score was around the bottom 10%.

4
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:45.040
Yooni Choi: This was so exciting. Can't you imagine what Gpt. 4 can do since Chat ipt is so powerful Already I have been using chat to extensively for my everyday work.

5
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:55.900
DAZHI PENG: if it is so powerful, according to open the Igbt for succeeding in the most recent public, the available test in a case of all linked and ap free response questions.

6
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:05.540
DAZHI PENG: all by pretty in 2,022 to 2,022 to 2,022, and they did No.

7
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.940
Jeffrey Feng: yeah. I think what's more exciting, that Gbd 4 can even accept visual. Inputs. There was an example on opening a website that the user asked.

8
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.910
Jeffrey Feng: What's funny about this image? Describe it panel by panel

9
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.410
Jeffrey Feng: and Gp for successfully identify all the interesting features of that image.

10
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:34.650
Yooni Choi: Given these features, I think it's definitely worthwhile for us to do a deep dive into its capabilities. Dr. Would you be able to read open AI's technical report for Gp: 4 and present a summary of it to the team.

11
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.180
DAZHI PENG: Yeah, I gotta do that.

12
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:50.450
Jeffrey Feng: Thank you. At the same time the bad news in the tech industry that matter starts another round of layoffs since last November. I think, Matt, I plan to lay off about 10,000 employees, or, roughly, 13 of its workforce.

13
00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:07.060
Yooni Choi: That's a lot of people. I remembered Meta already laid off 10,000 employees last year. The layoffs will affect me as recruiting team this week with a restructuring of its tech and business group to come in April and May. Mr. Zuckerberg set in the email posted on the company's website.

14
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.940
DAZHI PENG: I also heard this lay of you involved with all the methods, may have limited layer of management people.

15
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:22.520
DAZHI PENG: All right, Ernie's calling properly the chief and the group that he did no one the company to be overst with the of management or managers managing managers.

16
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.300
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, this is an interesting question for us to investigate as well.

17
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.490
Jeffrey Feng: Whether too much middle management people are actually helping or hurting the company.

18
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.480
Yooni Choi: It makes sense, because Meta has kept changing from Meta verse to AI, or vice versa. There is definitely something wrong with their leadership structure.

19
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.570
DAZHI PENG: There you need. Can you email me whether the management it's helping us in the Company efficiency.

20
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.010
Yooni Choi: Yeah, sure. Maybe other tech giants like Amazon or Google, or experiencing the same problem.

21
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.860
Jeffrey Feng: This was an interesting discussion. Have a good week, guys.
