DAZHI PENG: Hi! Guys glad to see you back from Spring Break.

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.580
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah. I just came back from North Carolina yesterday. I got depressed again, coming back to Facebook.

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.239
Yooni Choi: Hi me, too. I'm a staying in the polls of Cancun.

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:26.720
DAZHI PENG: Good. Let's start our weekly stand up meetings. We have a mentor meeting coming up next week, and I think it'll be great for us to space up our world today and make progress before meeting with them next week.

5
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.920
Jeffrey Feng: Yes, so far, I think UN has done a great job on investigating different call services as our efficiency.

6
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.860
Jeffrey Feng: But the action items and the general items are still on create us.

7
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:48.000
Yooni Choi: I agree there are many Nlp services that we can explore to achieve this task. Have you guys heard about the chat gpt from open AI? I think it would be a great Canada for this task.

8
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:57.820
DAZHI PENG: Yeah, it's amazing. I've been using it extensively for all my Icc project. I know nothing about spark people and educating a lot of great examples of collaboration.

9
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.170
DAZHI PENG: I think we could use it to extract an agenda and action items from the meeting Transcript.

10
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.040
Jeffrey Feng: Oh, then, would you be able to take on that task by next week? I believe Chat Jbt: would definitely help us allowing this project.

11
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.560
DAZHI PENG: Yeah, sure thing.

12
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.150
Jeffrey Feng: Okay, moving on to our next agenda Item. Have you guys decide what documents we should submit for the next week?

13
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.170
Yooni Choi: Yeah, let me take a quick look at canvas.

14
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.540
Yooni Choi: Okay, we have a plan and design document you next week. Most of the stuff seems to overlap a lot with our previous documents.

15
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:39.010
Jeffrey Feng: Yes, for the planned document. We have introduction, different tasks, milestone plans, terminology and incronom explanations, references, and reflection

16
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:49.590
DAZHI PENG: for the design of me. We are introduction to the encountering systems architecture Did a design implementation overview design models can design deployment and tools and dependencies.

17
00:01:50.510 --> 00:02:00.600
Yooni Choi: Okay, it doesn't seem too complicated. After finishing the documents we should submit them. I have 3 interviews next week, so I probably won't have enough time to double check the document system at them.

18
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.130
Jeffrey Feng: I am pretty flexible in the next week. So i'm fine with either way submitting the documents on great scope should be pretty straightforward.

19
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:17.230
DAZHI PENG: Yeah, I would also want to focus on Ec. Projects next week. That's another way. Any could without here. So i'll probably say another time in or next week.

20
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.650
DAZHI PENG: so I probably would also not be able to submit them.

21
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.950
Yooni Choi: Okay, Jeffrey, do you want to work on that? You can always let us know if you need any hope?

22
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.350
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, sure, I can do that i'll let you guys know when I finish the submission.

23
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.590
DAZHI PENG: Thank you very much for your help. Do you guys have anything you want to discuss in this meeting.

24
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.610
Yooni Choi: I think we are good. Everyone seems to have a clear idea what they're supposed to do next.

25
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.090
Jeffrey Feng: Okay, bye, bye.
