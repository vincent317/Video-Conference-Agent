DAZHI PENG: Hi, Jeffrey and a You let's talk about the data's grouping foreigners that you guys have. or this project for me alone.

2
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.780
Jeffrey Feng: Hi, do you. We are a bit stuck with scraping some of the websites on our list.

3
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.070
Jeffrey Feng: Some of them are dynamic, and I couldn't get the data we need.

4
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.650
Yooni Choi: Yeah, and i'm new to this task. So I was wondering if you could help us out.

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.550
DAZHI PENG: Of course I will be happy to help what it specifically do you need help with?

6
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:38.400
Jeffrey Feng: Well, many websites seem dynamic. so I was not able to figure out what to do to scrape them. I used a few python libraries, but they are not returning me. What I want

7
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.400
DAZHI PENG: Have you ready into the System Library?

8
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.740
Jeffrey Feng: I have not.

9
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:54.000
DAZHI PENG: Selenium is the software testing framework used to automate web browsers. It can similarly use their interactions with the website and then perform automated testing to check for errors.

10
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.640
DAZHI PENG: performance issues and functionality. Try for some of the website you were talking about.

11
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.080
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, how should I get started with that?

12
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.150
DAZHI PENG: You can start with documentation first. Re Stadiums documentation.

13
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.770
Jeffrey Feng: Okay.

14
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.510
Yooni Choi: So, Jeffrey, Have you been using the beautiful soup library?

15
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.870
Jeffrey Feng: Yes, that's one of the Python libraries that I've been using?

16
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.280
Yooni Choi: I kept having installation issues. I don't know what is the issue. My python version might be too old. Would you be able to help me with installation?

17
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.200
Jeffrey Feng: I'll help you with that. But before that, can you also update your python environment.

18
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.450
Yooni Choi: That'd be great. Thank you. Can I do anything besides that?

19
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.950
DAZHI PENG: Yeah, you are just waiting for the meeting for now? Meanwhile, I think you can read it into beautiful soups. Documentation

20
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.620
Yooni Choi: sounds good to me. I'll make sure I read that

21
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.900
DAZHI PENG: good. Could someone create a Github branch? I think, if I do that we can track the progress of this project.

22
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.830
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, I can take that

23
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.770
DAZHI PENG: all right. Sorry to overwhelm you with tasks. But before you guys go, would you? To make sure to report the progress tomorrow to me again?

Jeffrey Feng: Sure

25
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:13.000
Yooni Choi: sounds good to me, Jeffrey. Can you schedule a meeting with me later, so you can explain your previous code to me. I want to make sure I understand it.

26
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.150
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, that sounds good. I'll take this as my task

27
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.550
Jeffrey Feng: lots up to you for this project, but I will manage that.

28
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.750
Jeffrey Feng: What would you? What will we do if we run into further issues? Is it possible to add a new member to your team to help out with the project after this.

29
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.000
DAZHI PENG: Yeah, I will go ahead and do this.
