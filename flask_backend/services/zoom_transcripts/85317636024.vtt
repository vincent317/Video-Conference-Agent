DAZHI PENG: Hi, Jeff, we're in a union. Let's talk about the tailor scribing project that you guys have all this project coming along.

2
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.860
Jeffrey Feng: Hey, Dodger, we are a bit stuck with scraping some of the websites on our list.

3
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
Jeffrey Feng: Some of them are dynamic, and I couldn't get the data we need.

4
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.490
Yooni Choi: Yeah, I know, new to this task, so I was wondering if you could help us out.

5
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.200
DAZHI PENG: Of course I will be happy to shop. What specifically do you need help with.

6
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:39.390
Jeffrey Feng: Well, many websites seem dynamic, so I was not able to figure out what to do to scrape them. I used a few python libraries, but they are not returning me. What I want

7
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.470
DAZHI PENG: Have you ready into the library?

8
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.730
Jeffrey Feng: I have not.

9
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:55.820
DAZHI PENG: The lennium is a software testing equipment. We use to automate web browser. It can similarly user interactions with a website and from automated testing to check for error from issues and the function there

10
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:09.780
DAZHI PENG: trying to from the website you were talking about. Read the documentation with the beautiful suit documentation. You mean the ceiling and seleniums documentation.

11
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.870
Yooni Choi: So, Jeffrey, have you been using the beautiful soup library.

12
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.810
Jeffrey Feng: Yes, that's one of the Python libraries that I've been using.

13
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.840
Yooni Choi: I kept having installation issues. I don't know what is the issue. My python version might be too old. Would you mind helping one

14
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.630
Yooni Choi: python issue?

15
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.020
DAZHI PENG: I will help you with that.

16
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.160
Jeffrey Feng: Actually, I think help should be with installation issues. I don't think it's really a python thing.

17
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.270
Yooni Choi: Oh, okay.

18
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Jeffrey Feng: I will help you with that. Then, Nevertheless, could you update your python environment before that.

19
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.360
Yooni Choi: that would be great. Thank you. Is that really necessary? Though

20
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.950
Jeffrey Feng: the latest version of Python may have a fix for the issue you're having. If you're using older version of python. It is possible that a bug has been fixed in a newer version.

21
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.470
Yooni Choi: Oh, I see. Sure, let's do what you said.

22
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.960
DAZHI PENG: Well, you are waiting for Jeffrey to help you. I think you can already introduce telling us documentation.

23
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.440
Yooni Choi: I've not finished the beautiful soup part. Can I first start with something more relevant?

24
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:15.080
DAZHI PENG: Oh, yeah, sure, really beautiful to documentations. There. Good. Another thing. Do you guys want to send me the link to your Github branch?

25
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.100
Jeffrey Feng: We have not created a Github branch. Yet

26
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.380
DAZHI PENG: it is the to create a github, so we can track the progress of this project first.

27
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.930
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, I can do that by myself.

28
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:36.690
DAZHI PENG: Another action for both of you. I have list of people. The meeting is to report the progress to me sometime today. I so you guys can email me, but it looks like you guys are not ready yet.

29
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.650
Jeffrey Feng: That's true. Sorry about that.

30
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.700
Yooni Choi: We can report the progress to you by next week, though. Is that good for you?

31
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.440
DAZHI PENG: No, by tomorrow

32
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.700
Jeffrey Feng: we can give it a try.

33
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:57.690
Yooni Choi: Sounds good to me for the 2 of us working on it. Could we schedule a meeting layer, so you can explain your previous code to me. I want to make sure, Andrew, I understand your code, Jeffrey.

34
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.440
Jeffrey Feng: No, I do not have any previous call, but I can still schedule a meeting with you

35
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.270
DAZHI PENG: You need. Do you also want to do the recordings for the previous project?

36
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.270
Yooni Choi: I might be too busy with this fixed project.

37
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.680
DAZHI PENG: That's fine that we can discuss that later. All right, Great.

38
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.350
DAZHI PENG: And I want to add some new members to the teams you have up with this project. I will send you an update in a week.

39
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.390
Jeffrey Feng: Actually, i'm not sure if this is necessary.

40
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.430
Yooni Choi: Yeah, are you sure about that.

41
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:43.180
DAZHI PENG: Well, I agree that it might not be next 3. But the progress has been slow. Now I have enough budget. We can afford to do that although i'm not sure if I can even find someone, I will still put this on my action and see who I can find.

42
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.690
DAZHI PENG: Let's do one more you as member to the team. Does that sound good?

43
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.960
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, I understand.

44
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.810
Thanks, Dr.
