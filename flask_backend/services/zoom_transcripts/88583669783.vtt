DAZHI PENG: Hi, Jeffrey, and a unique. Let's talk about the data screaming project that you guys have of this project coming along.

2
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.460
Jeffrey Feng: Hi, do you?

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:22.620
Jeffrey Feng: We we are a bit stuck with scraping some of the websites on our list. Some of them are dynamic, and I couldn't get the data we need.

4
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.240
Yooni Choi: Yeah, and i'm new to this task. So I was wondering if you could help us out.

5
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.110
DAZHI PENG: Of course I will be happy to help what specifically you need help with.

6
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.430
Jeffrey Feng: Well, many websites seem dynamic, so I was not able to figure out what to do to scrape them.

7
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.720
I used a few python libraries, but they are not returning me when I want.

8
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.690
DAZHI PENG: Have you ready to use the selenium? The library?

9
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.350
Jeffrey Feng: I have not.

10
00:00:51.830 --> 00:01:01.890
DAZHI PENG: Selenium is a software testing framework used to automated web browsers. and it can similarly use their interactions with the website and perform automated testing to check where

11
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.840
DAZHI PENG: performance issues and functionality. Try for some of the website you are talking about.

12
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.590
Jeffrey Feng: Sure. Jeffrey's first action item would be to read Selenium's documentation, then.

13
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.590
Yooni Choi: So, Jeffrey, have you been using the beautiful suit library.

14
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.240
Jeffrey Feng: Yes, that's one of the Python libraries that I've been using.

15
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.230
Yooni Choi: I kept having installation issues. I don't know what is what is the issue, though my python version might be too old.

16
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.100
Jeffrey Feng: I'll help you with that, I guess. Another of Jeffrey's action item would be to help you with installation issues.

17
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.100
Jeffrey Feng: Could you update your python environment before that

18
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.280
Yooni Choi: That would be great. Thank you. You will up to her python environment as our action item.

19
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.580
DAZHI PENG: Well, you are waiting for Jeffrey to help you. I think you can read into beautiful soups. Documentation

20
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.560
Yooni Choi: sounds good to me. You will make sure to read beautiful suit documentation as your second action. Item.

21
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.760
DAZHI PENG: good Jeffrey, could you create a Github branch? So we can check the progress of this project.

22
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.970
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, I can do that.

23
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.120

27
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.810
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, that sounds good. Jeffrey was scheduling a meeting with Uni as another action item of my

28
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.780
