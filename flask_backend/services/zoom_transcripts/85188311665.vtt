DAZHI PENG: Hi, Jeff, we're gonna use. Let's talk about the data scripting for that. You guys have all this for you coming along.

2
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:19.280
Jeffrey Feng: Hey, Dodger, we are so bit stuck with scraping some of the websites on our list. Some of them are dynamic, and I couldn't get the data we need.

3
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.870
Yooni Choi: Yeah, and i'm new to this task. So I was wondering if you could help us out.

4
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.360
DAZHI PENG: Of course I will be having your help. What is specifically do you need help with.

5
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.410
Jeffrey Feng: Well, many websites seem dynamic, so I was not able to figure out what to do to scrape them. I used a few python libraries, but they are not returning me. What I want

6
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.370
DAZHI PENG: have you read into the television library?

7
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.950
Jeffrey Feng: I have not.

8
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:58.380
DAZHI PENG: So it's a software, testing. We we use to automate web browsers. It can similarly user interactions with the website and for phone automated testing to check for errors, performance issues and the functionality.

9
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.320
DAZHI PENG: Try for some of the website you were talking about.

10
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.970
Jeffrey Feng: Sure. Jeffrey's first task will be to read Selenium's documentation, then.

11
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.380
Yooni Choi: So, Jeffrey, have you been using the beautiful soup library.

12
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.840
Jeffrey Feng: Yes, that's one of the Python libraries that I've been using.

13
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.200
Yooni Choi: I kept having installation issues. I don't know what is the issue. My python version might be too old.

14
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.220
Jeffrey Feng: I'll help you with that.

15
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.250
Jeffrey Feng: I guess. Another of Geoffrey's to do. I will be to help you with installation issues. Could you update your python environment before that

16
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.710
Yooni Choi: that would be great. Thank you. You knew all up to your python environment as your task

17
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.190
DAZHI PENG: while you are waiting for Jeffrey to help you. I think you can really into Google. Soup's documentation

18
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.830
Yooni Choi: sounds good to me. You will make sure to read beautiful suit documentation as another thing to go.

19
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.110
DAZHI PENG: Good Jeffrey, could you create a github price? So we can fix the progress of this project.

20
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.780
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, I can do that. Jeffrey will also put work on creating a Github branch. Then

21

23
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.760
Yooni Choi: sounds good to me, Jeffrey. Could we schedule a meeting later? So you can explain your previous code to me. I want to make sure I understand it.

24
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.590
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, that sounds good. Another task. Jeffrey was scheduled a meeting with you

25
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:36.140
