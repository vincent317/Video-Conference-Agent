00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.440
DAZHI PENG: Hi, Jeffrey, and you need let's talk about the data scripting project that you back to policy. This project coming along.

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.970
Jeffrey Feng: Hey, Dodgy. We are a bit stuck with scraping some of the websites on our list. Some of them are dynamic, and I couldn't get the data we need.

3
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.080
Yooni Choi: Yeah, and i'm new to this task, so I was wondering if you could help us out.

4
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.580
DAZHI PENG: Of course I will be happy to help it's specifically to you need help with.

5
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.280
Jeffrey Feng: Well, many websites seem dynamic, so I was not able to figure out what to do to scrape them.

6
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.350
Jeffrey Feng: I used a few python libraries, but they are not returning me. What I want

7
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.550
DAZHI PENG: have you already in the

8
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.150
Jeffrey Feng: I have not.

9
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:56.840
DAZHI PENG: It's a software testing room of used to your automated web browsers. It can similarly use the interactions with the website and of all the testing to check for error

10
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.150
DAZHI PENG: performance issues and functionality. Try for some of the website you are talking about.

11
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.680
Jeffrey Feng: Sure.

12
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.790
Jeffrey Feng: Jeffrey's first action item will be to read beautiful Soup's documentation, then

13
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.980
DAZHI PENG: you mean a documentation.

14
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.400
Jeffrey Feng: Oh, yeah, Oops, Sorry I meant the selenium documentation.

15
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.110
Yooni Choi: So, Jeffrey, have you been using the beautiful soup library?

16
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.930
Jeffrey Feng: Yes, that's one of the Python libraries that I've been using.

17
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.050
Yooni Choi: I kept having installation issues I don't know what is the issue. My python version might be too old.

18
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.350
Jeffrey Feng: I'll help you with that. I guess another of Jeffrey's action items will be to help you with price on issues.

19
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.730
Yooni Choi: Actually, I want to help with installation issues. I don't think it is really the python thing.

20
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.510
Jeffrey Feng: Oh, okay, I'll help you with that, then. nonetheless, could you update your python environment before that as another action? Item.

21
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.030
Yooni Choi: that'd be great. Thank you. Is that really necessary? Though

22
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:05.550
Jeffrey Feng: the latest version of Python may have fixed for the issue you're having. If you're using a older version of Python, it is possible that a bug has been fixed in a new version.

23
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.380
Yooni Choi: Oh, I see. Sure, let's do what you said.

24
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.030
DAZHI PENG: Well, you are waiting for Jeffrey to help you. I think you can ready into the selenium's documentation to actually, I

25
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.310
Yooni Choi: I have not finished to be those beautiful soup part. Can I first start with something more relevant?

26
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.320
DAZHI PENG: Oh, yeah, sure, really beautiful soup's documentation. There, good Jeffrey, would you send me the link to your kid Up, grandchild? Another action, Icon.

27
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.240
Jeffrey Feng: I have not created a Github branch yet

28
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.200
DAZHI PENG: this is not good. Create a Github branch, so we can track the progress of this project first.

29
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.170
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, I can do that.

30
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.900
DAZHI PENG: Another action for both of you that I have listed all people in the meeting.

31
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.150
DAZHI PENG: Jeffrey, and a unique is to report the progress to me sometime today.

32
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.750
DAZHI PENG: I thought you guys can email me. But it looks like you guys are not not ready yet.

33
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.540
Jeffrey Feng: That's true. Sorry about that.

34
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.800
Yooni Choi: We can report the progress to you by next week, though. Is that good for you?

35
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.720
DAZHI PENG: No, by tomorrow

36
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.460
Jeffrey Feng: we can give a try.

37
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.470
Yooni Choi: Sounds good to me, Jeffrey. Could we schedule a meeting later? So you can explain your code to me. I want to make sure I understand it.

38
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.810
Jeffrey Feng: No, I do not have any previous call, but I can still schedule a meeting with you

39
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:32.620
DAZHI PENG: you need. Do you also want to do the recordings for the previous? I might be too busy with this Week's Project

40
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.990
DAZHI PENG: all right, great. And for that just I try to. He will also add some new members to the team to help with this project.

41
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.090
DAZHI PENG: I will send you off in a week.

42
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.950
Jeffrey Feng: Actually, i'm not sure if this is necessary.

43
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.870
Yooni Choi: Yeah, are you sure about that?

44
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.820
DAZHI PENG: Well, I agree that it it might not be necessary, but the progress has been slow. No, I have enough budget. We can afford to do that.

45
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.160
DAZHI PENG: although i'm not sure if I can even find someone.

46
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:08.810
DAZHI PENG: I will still put this on My. let's do one more using new members to the team. Does that sound good?

47
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.110
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, I understand.
