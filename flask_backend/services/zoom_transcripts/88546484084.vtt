DAZHI PENG: Hi, Jeffrey and a Union. Let's talk about the data scribing project that you guys have all this project coming along.

2
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:17.750
Jeffrey Feng: Hi, Dodger, we're a bit stuck with scraping some of the websites on our list. Some of them are dynamic, and I couldn't get the data we need.

3
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.740
Yooni Choi: Yeah, I know new to this task, so I was wondering if you could help us out.

4
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.450
DAZHI PENG: Of course I will be happy to help, or specifically do you need help with.

5
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.120
Jeffrey Feng: Well, many websites seem dynamic, so I was not able to figure out what to do to scrape them.

6
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.210
Jeffrey Feng: I used a few python libraries, but they are not returning me. What I want

7
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.470
DAZHI PENG: have you ready into the

8
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.750
Jeffrey Feng: I have not

9
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:53.350
DAZHI PENG: Solution is the software testing framework used to automate web browsers. It can similarly use their interactions with the website by from automated testing to check for

10
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.460
DAZHI PENG: performance issues in the functionality. Try it for some of the website you were talking about.

11
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.250
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, how should I get started with that?

12
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.740
DAZHI PENG: You can start with documentation. Jeffrey. First to breathe a little with documentation as your first half.

13
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.970
Jeffrey Feng: Okay.

14
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.100
Yooni Choi: So, Jeffrey, have you been using the beautiful soup library?

15
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.470
Jeffrey Feng: Yes, that's one of the Python libraries that I've been using?

16
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:30.510
Yooni Choi: I kept having installation issues. I don't know what is the issue? My python version might be too old, Jeffrey. Would you be able to help me with installation as another task?

17
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:40.700
Jeffrey Feng: I will help you with that. But you need. Can we also update your python environment before that. I think this is the important task. Before I look into anything

18
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.750
Yooni Choi: that would be great. Thank you.

19
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.860
DAZHI PENG: Yeah, you are just waiting for the meeting. Now you name. I think you can ready into the doable soups documentation. Well, Jeffrey, that is, app

20
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.680
Yooni Choi: sounds good to me. I will make sure. I read that

21
00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.620
DAZHI PENG: good Jeffrey last individual task for you. Could you create a data branch? I think by doing that we can track the progress of this project.

22
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.700
Jeffrey Feng: Sure, I can do that

23
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:15.380
DAZHI PENG: all right. Sorry to overwhelm you with tasks. But before you guys go, Jeffrey, and a unique. Could you to make sure to report the programs tomorrow to me again?

24
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.630
Jeffrey Feng: Sure

25
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.930
Yooni Choi: sounds good, Jeffrey. Can you schedule a meeting with me later, so you can explain your previous code to me. I want to make sure I understand it.

26
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.520
Jeffrey Feng: Yeah, that sounds good. I'll take this at my task. Lots of to do for this project, but I will manage that.

27
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.880
Jeffrey Feng: That you. What would you do if we run into further issues? Can you add the new member to the team to help out with the project after this.

28
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.960
DAZHI PENG: Yeah, I will go ahead and do this. Thank you for the reminder. I will send you all updates in a week.

29
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.630
Yooni Choi: Thanks, Dr.
